  abstract = {This paper reports the results of an experimental study that investigated the feasibility of using ﬁne and coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) with slag or ﬂy ash to produce Controlled Low-Strength Materials (CLSM). The main objective was to produce CLSM using only recycled and by-product materials without the need to add Portland cement. In addition to the hydraulic activity of slag and high-calcium ﬂy ash (HCFA), their pozzolanic reaction was activated by the alkalis and calcium hydroxide present in the residual paste of the RCA. Preliminary tests showed mixtures with slag to have 7-day compressive strengths 70\% higher than mixtures with ﬂy ash.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspeciﬁc competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene ﬂow. Gene ﬂow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspeciﬁc competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

  abstract = {The current distribution of forest genetic resources on Earth is the result of a combination of natural processes and human actions. Over time, tree populations have become adapted to their habitats including the local ecological disturbances they face. As the planet enters a phase of human-induced climate change of unprecedented speed and magnitude, however, previously locally-adapted populations are rendered less suitable for new conditions, and ‘natural’ biotic and abiotic disturbances are taken outside their historic distribution, frequency and intensity ranges. Tree populations rely on phenotypic plasticity to survive in extant locations, on genetic adaptation to modify their local phenotypic optimum or on migration to new suitable environmental conditions. The rate of required change, however, may outpace the ability to respond, and tree species and populations may become locally extinct after speciﬁc, but as yet unknown and unquantiﬁed, tipping points are reached. Here, we review the importance of forest genetic resources as a source of evolutionary potential for adaptation to changes in climate and other ecological factors. We particularly consider climate-related responses in the context of linkages to disturbances such as pests, diseases and ﬁre, and associated feedback loops. The importance of management strategies to conserve evolutionary potential is emphasised and recommendations for policy-makers are provided.},

Genetic monitoring has been recognized in several international agreements and documents, and can be an important tool for the protection of biodiversity. However, approaches developed so far for perennial plant species are rather cumbersome for practical use. It is proposed that perennial plant genetic monitoring should focus on keystone species of biological and economical importance, as well as rare or endangered species. In addition, genetic monitoring should concentrate on gene conservation units of such species, to be advanced in a dynamic gene conservation scheme. Three indicators are proposed for genetic monitoring based on a gene-ecological approach: natural selection, genetic drift, and a gene flow-mating system. These are evaluated based on three demographic (age and size class distribution, reproductive fitness, regeneration abundance) and four genetic (effective population size, allelic richness, latent genetic potential, outcrossing/actual inbreeding rate) parameters. Minimum sample sizes, critical levels of differences among parameters, and costs for temporal evaluation are proposed. The benefits of the immediate application of genetic monitoring are highlighted.},

The review focuses on silviculture and management systems, regeneration schemes, the consequences of coppicing and coppice conversion to high forest, the effects of fragmentation and exploitation, and the genetic impact of forestry plantations. It emerges that averaging genetic diversity parameters, such as those typically reported in the assessment of forest population genetics, do not generally present significant differences between populations under certain silvicultural systems/forest management methods and “control” populations. Observed differences are usually rather subtler and regard the structure of the genetic variation and the lasting adaptive potential of natural forest tree populations. Therefore, forest management and silvicultural practices have a longer-term impact on the genetic diversity and structure and resilience of long-impacted populations of forest tree; their assessment should be based on parameters that are sensitive to population perturbations and bottlenecks. The nature and extent of genetic effects and impact of silviculture and forest management practices, call for a concerted effort regarding their thorough study using genetic, genomic, as well as monitoring approaches, in order to provide insight and potential solutions for future silviculture and management regimes.},

Eight enzyme systems were studied. Genetic variability within and between populations was found to be high and can be regarded as the highest reported among natural European populations. The comparison between old-growth natural and coppice populations showed no statistically significant differences in heterozygosity. Seven quantitative parameters were also recorded. Analysis of variance indicated significant differences between the populations studied. The high diversity observed in genetic and quantitative variation is very important for both the development of breeding applications and the conservation of the species’ genetic resources.},

  abstract = {In the expected climatic change scenario (with increased temperatures and water deficits) related to greenhouse effect phenomena, questions are being raised concerning the migration of the potential range of forest specie (contraction in the south and at lower altitudes, extension towards the north and higher altitudes) and the consequences on silviculture. To answer these questions, information about climatic changes and the ecophysiology of the forest species concerned is required. In this paper the case of circum-Mediterranean firs is examined as they could be in danger in parts of their present range but could also provide valuable solutions for the replacement of other species in more northerly zones with temperate humid climates and that would not be adapted to new climatic conditions. We try to answer these questions using a simplified climatic analysis of the original ranges and knowledge about the ecology and ecophysiology of firs. In the original ranges of these species climatic data is rare and very incomplete. Under these conditions it is impossible to undertake a detailed climatological analysis. Also, taking into account the diversity and heterogeneity of the climatic descriptions made by the various authors, and so as to be able to compare the different firs species, we used an aridity index. By taking a numerical approach, this index allowed us to have a general and comparative view of the climatology of the original fir ranges in relation to drought problems, and also to simulate evolution easily and compare it with the present situations for each species. On the basis of all the different results obtained it seems that, in relation to a possible increase in drought linked to a temperature increase (except no doubt for Abies numidica and A. pinsapo), there is a great risk that the present ranges of circum-Mediterranean firs will decrease in the lowest zones of their range, but also in other zones characterized by southerly aspects and shallow soils. For Abies cephalonica and Abies cilicica, species with early bud burst, there is also the risk of a possible increase in late frost damage in addition to water stress effects. Except for A. nordmanniana and A. bornmulleriana, other species may also be concerned, but to a lesser extent. Regarding the replacement of species, which would become necessary in the case of climatic change, with the exceptions of A. nordmanniana which has already been used and of for A. nebrodensis, these firs could be an alternative to the regression of more hygrophilous species, especially in zones to the north of their present ranges.},

In the research presented herein we extended published work on heritable changes in the DNA methylation pattern of Solanaceae scion genomes, in Cucurbitaceae inter-species grafting. Specifically, we examined global DNA methylation changes in scions of cucumber, melon and watermelon heterografted onto pumpkin rootstocks using MSAP analysis. We observed a significant increase of global DNA methylation in cucumber and melon scions pointing to an epigenetic effect in Cucurbitaceae heterografting. Exploitation of differential epigenetic marking in different rootstock-scion combinations could lead to development of epi-molecular markers for generation and selection of superior quality grafted vegetables.},

These interactions are varied and sometimes complex, and may be negative and unintended or associated with conservation and management strategy. Understanding the details of how these interactions inﬂuence and are inﬂuenced by natural evolutionary processes is essential to the development of effective conservation strategies. In this study, we investigate a species in Britain that has experienced both negative impact through overhunting in historical times and management efforts through culls and translocations. At the same time, there are regional populations that have been less affected by human inﬂuence. We use mtDNA and nuclear microsatellite DNA markers to investigate patterns of connectivity and diversity and ﬁnd multiple insular populations in Britain that probably evolved within the Holocene (when the habitat was free of ice). We identify three concurrent processes. First, surviving indigenous populations show highly provincial patterns of philopatry, maintaining and generating population structure on a small geographic scale. Second, founder populations into habitat extirpated of native populations have expanded, but remained largely insular. Third, introductions into established populations generate some admixture. We discuss the implications for the evolution of diversity of the integration of natural processes with anthropogenic inﬂuences on population size and distribution.},

Small sample sizes often lead to significant errors in determining the allelic richness, which is one of the most important and commonly used estimators of genetic diversity in populations. Correct estimation of allelic richness in natural populations is challenging since they often do not conform to model assumptions. Here, we introduce a simple and robust approach to estimate the genetic diversity in large natural populations based on the empirical data for finite sample sizes.
Results: We developed a non-linear regression model to infer genetic diversity estimates in large natural populations from finite sample sizes. The allelic richness values predicted by our model were in good agreement with those observed in the simulated data sets and the true allelic richness observed in the source populations. The model has been validated using simulated population genetic data sets with different evolutionary scenarios implied in the simulated populations, as well as large microsatellite and allozyme experimental data sets for four conifer species with contrasting patterns of inherent genetic diversity and mating systems. Our model was a better predictor for allelic richness in natural populations than the widely-used Ewens sampling formula, coalescent approach, and rarefaction algorithm.
Conclusions: Our regression model was capable of accurately estimating allelic richness in natural populations regardless of the species and marker system. This regression modeling approach is free from assumptions and can be widely used for population genetic and conservation applications.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a new general method for genealogical inference that samples independent genealogical histories using importance sampling (IS) and then samples other parameters with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). It is then possible to more easily utilize the advantages of importance sampling in a fully Bayesian framework. The method is applied to the problem of estimating recent changes in effective population size from temporally spaced gene frequency data. The method gives the posterior distribution of effective population size at the time of the oldest sample and at the time of the most recent sample, assuming a model of exponential growth or decline during the interval. The effect of changes in number of alleles, number of loci, and sample size on the accuracy of the method is described using test simulations, and it is concluded that these have an approximately equivalent effect. The method is used on three example data sets and problems in interpreting the posterior densities are highlighted and discussed.},

The aim of the research was to evaluate the diversity present in Italian populations of the species. Genetic diversity was assessed in 45 silver fir populations covering the species’ distribution range in Italy, based on the allelic variation present at seven microsatellite loci (SSRs). A consistent level of intra-population variability was present. Several of the populations displayed signs of ongoing genetic erosion, and evidence for a recent bottleneck in some was identified. Populations from the eastern Alps and the Apennines were more variable than those sampled from the western Alps. About 8\% of the overall genetic variance was found between populations, with the remainder representing variation present within the populations. The data suggested that the southern Apennines acted as a refugium during the most recent Ice Age, and that many of the populations from this area have remained isolated over a prolonged period. Smaller and more isolated populations have experienced genetic drift, whereas the larger ones have preserved a high level of diversity. Identification of genetically homogeneous regions could be informative for the management of genetic resources.},

For this purpose, the basic notions of physiological and evolutionary adaptive potential are briefly discussed in connection with operating and latent genetic potentials of populations. A measure for the quantification of latent genetic potential is introduced together with a procedure that evaluates the detective power of the samples taken. The results obtained from application of this measure are in striking accordance with earlier suggestions based chieflyon ecophysiological traits, and which assume both low physiological and evolutionary adaptive potential in the central and northeastern European populations of silver fir. Moreover, careful consideration of the structural and functional characteristics of the enzymes used in the present study support the assumption that they are not selectivelyneutral, and in one case it can indeed be demonstrated that the two alleles at a locus are very likely to be under selection for temperature differences between central and southern European populations.},

The sediment retention service is mentioned among the regulation ecosystem services in all the main international classifications (MA, TEEB, CICES). It refers to the capacity of ecosystems to regulate the quantity of eroded sediment reaching the stream network, and thus delivering benefits like maintaining soil and water quality and reservoir functions. This paper aims to assess the link between possible land cover changes and the sediment retention service provided by the vegetation cover. The analysis focuses on a mountain landscape from the upper catchment of Râul Târgului, Iezer Mountains in the Romanian Carpathians. To this purpose, we considered recent changes in the forest landscape (2005-2012) and, with the participation of local administrative stakeholders, we developed three land cover scenarios (Business-as-Usual, Conservation and Development). For each simulated land cover map we compared the supply of sediment retention services by using quantitative indicators: sediment retention, sediment export and the amount of potential soil loss. For the processing of spatial data we applied GIS techniques using the ArcGIS software (ESRI) and for the modeling we used the InVEST 3.2 software (Natural Capital Project). One of our major findings is that the landscape of 2012 retained approximately 3 million tons/year of sediment. Further on, our results show the highest decrease in the sediment retention service for the Development scenario and the highest increase for the Conservation scenario. However, these changes represent less than 2\% of the 2012 values. Overall, our results show that the tools and models used proved to deliver credible and relevant results and can be used for future local landscape planning.},

  abstract = {Background:  Although the importance of using local provenance planting stock for woodland production, habitat conservation and restoration remains contentious, the concept is easy to understand, attractive and easy to ‘sell’. With limited information about the extent and scale of adaptive variation in native trees, discussion about suitable seed sources often emphasises “local” in a very narrow sense or within political boundaries, rather than being based on sound evidence of the scale over which adaptation occurs. Concerns exist over the actual scale (magnitude and spatial scale) of adaptation in trees and the relative dangers of incorrect seed source or restricted seed collection, leading to the establishment of trees with restricted genetic diversity and limited adaptive potential. Tree provenance and progeny field trials in many parts of the world have shown the existence of genotype by environment interaction in many tree species, but have not necessarily looked at whether this is expressed as a home site advantage (i.e. whether provenance performance is unstable across sites, and there is better performance of a local seed source). Methods/design:  This review will examine the evidence for local adaptation and its scale in a number of native tree species from different trial sites across the globe (e.g. tropical, Mediterranean, temperate). These trials have been measured and in some cases results published in a range of formats. The data have, however, usually been presented in the form of which provenances grow best at which sites. The review will examine existing data (published and unpublished) in the context of the scale of local adaptation, with the results being presented in two formats: (a) relating survival, performance of provenances (classified by seed zone/provenance region of origin) to seed zone/provenance region of the planting site; (b) plotting survival, performance provenances against the distance (Euclidean/ ecological) between the provenance and the trial site.},

  abstract = {Their relatively slow rates of molecular evolution, as well as frequent exposure to hybridization and introgression, often make it difficult to discriminate species of vascular plants with the standard barcode markers (rbcL, matK, ITS2). Previous studies have examined these constraints in narrow geographic or taxonomic contexts, but the present investigation expands analysis to consider the performance of these gene regions in discriminating the species in local floras at sites across Canada. To test identification success, we employed a DNA barcode reference library with sequence records for 96\% of the 5108 vascular plant species known from Canada, but coverage varied from 94\% for rbcL to 60\% for ITS2 and 39\% for matK. Using plant lists from 27 national parks and one scientific reserve, we tested the efficacy of DNA barcodes in identifying the plants in simulated species assemblages from six biogeographic regions of Canada using BLAST and mothur. Mean pairwise distance (MPD) and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) were strong predictors of barcode performance for different plant families and genera, and both metrics supported ITS2 as possessing the highest genetic diversity. All three genes performed strongly in assigning the taxa present in local floras to the correct genus with values ranging from 91\% for rbcL to 97\% for ITS2 and 98\% for matK. However, matK delivered the highest species discrimination (\textasciitilde{}81\%) followed by ITS2 (\textasciitilde{}72\%) and rbcL (\textasciitilde{}44\%). Despite the low number of plant taxa in the Canadian Arctic, DNA barcodes had the least success in discriminating species from this biogeographic region with resolution ranging from 36\% with rbcL to 69\% with matK. Species resolution was higher in the other settings, peaking in the Woodland region at 52\% for rbcL and 87\% for matK. Our results indicate that DNA barcoding is very effective in identifying Canadian plants to a genus, and that it performs well in discriminating species in regions where floristic diversity is highest.},

In contrast to most previous studies of large mammals we found evidence for negative density dependence in adult survival in this large carnivore. Both sexes showed the same pattern of density dependence, with higher annual survival rates in adult females than males. In addition, we also found an additive mortality effect of harvesting in the population, resulting in the lowest adult survival rates at a combination of high population density and high harvest rate. The additive effects of density and harvest on adult survival of wolverines have relevance to the conservation and management of solitary carnivores with strong intrasexual territoriality, especially for species where combats among conspeciﬁcs can cause serious injury or even mortality.},

In this study, we used 12 microsatellite loci to examine the genetic structure of 10 Ae. aegypti populations from throughout the Florida Keys and Miami to assess gene flow along the region’s main roadway, the Overseas Highway. We also assessed temporal genetic stability of populations in Key West to determine whether the recent outbreak could have been the result of a new introduction of mosquitoes. Though a small amount of geographic genetic structure was detected, our results showed high overall genetic similarity among Ae. aegypti populations sampled in southeastern Florida. No temporal genetic signal was detected in Key West populations collected before and after the outbreak. Consequently, there is potential for dengue transmission across southeastern Florida; renewed mosquito control and surveillance measures should be taken.},

The variance of the number of heterozygous loci in two randomly chosen gametes affords a useful measure of such association. The behavior of this statistic in several particular models is described. Generally, linkage (gametic phase) disequilibrium tends to increase the variance above the value expected under complete independence. This increase is greatest when disequilibria are such as to maximize the sum of squares of the two-locus gametic frequencies.-When data on several loci per individual are available, the observed variance may be tested for its agreement with that expected under the hypothesis of complete interlocus independence, using the sampling theory of this model. When applied to allozyme data from 26 polymorphic populations of wild barley, this test demonstrated the presence of geographically widespread multilocus organization. On average, the variance was 80\% higher than expected under random association. Gametic frequencies for four esterase loci in both of these populations of wild barley and two composite crosses of cultivated barley were analyzed. Most generations of the composites showed less multilocus structure, as measured by the indices of association, than the wild populations.},

We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures (ÔinsuranceÕ effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further conﬁrmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

If instead environmental impact is minimized, the utilization rate for Scandinavia is almost the same, while the utilization rate for the rest of Europe is 53\% (a lower assumed level).

  abstract = {The ability of populations to undergo adaptive evolution depends on the presence of quantitative genetic variation for ecologically important traits. Although molecular measures are widely used as surrogates for quantitative genetic variation, there is controversy about the strength of the relationship between the two. To resolve this issue, we carried out a meta-analysis based on 71 datasets. The mean correlation between molecular and quantitative measures of genetic variation was weak (r ϭ 0.217). Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant relationship between the two measures for life-history traits (r ϭ Ϫ0.11) or for the quantitative measure generally considered as the best indicator of adaptive potential, heritability (r ϭ Ϫ0.08). Consequently, molecular measures of genetic diversity have only a very limited ability to predict quantitative genetic variability. When information about a population’s short-term evolutionary potential or estimates of local adaptation and population divergence are required, quantitative genetic variation should be measured directly.},

  abstract = {Marginal populations are expected to provide the frontiers for adaptation, evolution and range shifts of plant species under the anticipated climate change conditions. Marginal populations are predicted to show genetic divergence from central populations due to their isolation, and divergent natural selection and genetic drift operating therein. Marginal populations are also expected to have lower genetic diversity and effective population size (Ne) and higher genetic differentiation than central populations. We tested these hypotheses using eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) as a model for keystone, long-lived widely-distributed plants. All 614 eastern white pine trees, in a complete census of two populations each of marginal oldgrowth, central old-growth, and central second-growth, were genotyped at 11 microsatellite loci. The central populations had significantly higher allelic and genotypic diversity, latent genetic potential (LGP) and Ne than the marginal populations. However, heterozygosity and fixation index were similar between them. The marginal populations were genetically diverged from the central populations. Model testing suggested predominant north to south gene flow in the study area with curtailed gene flow to northern marginal populations. Signatures of natural selection were detected at three loci in the marginal populations; two showing divergent selection with directional change in allele frequencies, and one balancing selection. Contrary to the general belief, no significant differences were observed in genetic diversity, differentiation, LGP, and Ne between old-growth and second-growth populations. Our study provides information on the dynamics of migration, genetic drift and selection in central versus marginal populations of a keystone long-lived plant species and has broad evolutionary, conservation and adaptation significance.},

The geology, climate, flora and phytogeography of the island of Ikaria are discussed. Its wild vascular flora consists of 829 taxa, 233 of which are first-time records for the island. 13 Greek and 29 Aegean endemic taxa are present on the island of Ikaria, 15 of which are currently known to occur only on Ikaria. Among the Greek endemic taxa, Onosma kaheirei, Crépis hellenica and Sedum delicum are new records for the E. Aegean region. A concise species list with indication of life-form, chorological data and notes on species habitats is provided. In the life-form spectrum therophytes are dominant (49\%) as a result of the summer extensive dry period. 17 chorological groups are distinguished, with the Mediterranean element being the dominant one. The high proportion of the Mediterranean element, in conjunction with the high percentage of therophytes, are indicative of the strong Mediterranean character of the island's flora. The largest proportion of plants (63\%) are autochthonous and are thought to be remnants of a former Aegean continental flora. A considerable proportion (27\%) are anthropophytes, while those plants whose presence is a result of natural, long-distance dispersal are limited (10\%). On the basis of this data, Ikaria exhibits a typically Aegean floristic character. The cliffs at the middle part of the island and the summit of Mt. Atheras, with it's largely undisturbed, endemic rich flora should be declared as a nature reserve.},

Similarity coefﬁcient values from 0.13 to 0.93 (with an average of 0.48) were found among the 56 accessions examined, which indicated the presence of a high degree of genetic variability. Most international cultivars were grouped together while most Greek native populations could not be placed into a distinct group. The Greek native population genotypes were found more diverse than the international cultivars. The mean similarity coefﬁcient values for the former and latter were 0.44 and 0.56, respectively. In the cultivar group, two subgroups were distinguished; one consisted of genotypes involving ‘Payne’ and the other ‘Franquette’ in their pedigrees. Some cultivars and populations could not be grouped according to their pedigrees or collection area. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that a larger part of the genetic variation exists among Greek walnut populations within a collection region (89\%) than among the regions (11\%). The pairwise regional PhiPT values indicated that the most geographically distant regions are the most genetically differentiated. The high variability existing in the Greek germplasm in combination with their valuable agro-morphological traits suggested that it would be beneﬁcial to utilize this native germplasm pool in walnut breeding programs and germplasm management activities to maximize genetic diversity in cultivated walnut.},

  abstract = {Greece, as part of the Mediterranean Basin, is projected to be among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is therefore quite urgent to adapt forest management to the changing climate in order to enhance biodiversity and to enable the conservation of healthy and productive forests. In the framework of the project LIFE? AdaptFor (www.life-adaptfor.gr), an effort was made to understand the ecological responses and the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in the face of climate change; the overall aim of the project is the development and implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies. Four study areas were selected where changes in vegetation, quite likely attributed to climate change, have already been observed (dieback of Scots pine and Greek ﬁr, intrusion of conifers in broadleaved forests). To investigate the synergism of climatic parameters’ alterations in the development of the occurring phenomena, time series of temperature and precipitation for the period 1950–2009 were produced and parameters of forest status were investigated, including mapping of vegetation changes through remote sensing. The ﬁndings support the hypothesis that climate change has an impact on forest health; the dieback of tree species can be attributed to outbreaks of pathogens (fungi and insects) which are associated with climatic parameters. However, the intrusion of conifer species into broadleaved forests showed no direct connection to climatic parameters, something that needs to be further investigated. In all cases, insufﬁcient or inappropriate management practices applied in the areas exacerbated the occurring phenomena.},

Far fewer attempts have been made to give a historical synthesis of the events that led to the cultivation of sweet chestnut in much earlier times. In this article we attempt to reconstruct this part of the European history of chestnut cultivation and its early diffusion by use of different sources of information, such as pollen studies, archaeology, history and literature. Using this multidisciplinary approach, we have tried to identify the roles of the Greek and Roman civilizations in the dissemination of chestnut cultivation on a European scale. In particular, we show that use of the chestnut for food was not the primary driving force behind the introduction of the tree into Europe by the Romans. Apart from the Insubrian Region in the north of the Italian peninsula, no other centre of chestnut cultivation existed in Europe during the Roman period. The Romans may have introduced the idea of systematically cultivating and using chestnut. In certain cases they introduced the species itself; however no evidence of systematic planting of chestnut exists. The greatest interest in the management of chestnut for fruit production most probably developed after the Roman period and can be associated with the socio-economic structures of medieval times. It was then that self-sufficient cultures based on the cultivation of chestnut as a source of subsistence were formed.},

  abstract = {Background: Determination of microsatellite lengths or other DNA fragment types is an important initial component of many genetic studies such as mutation detection, linkage and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, genetic diversity, pedigree analysis, and detection of heterozygosity. A handful of commercial and freely available software programs exist for fragment analysis; however, most of them are platform dependent and lack high-throughput applicability.
Results: We present the R package Fragman to serve as a freely available and platform independent resource for automatic scoring of DNA fragment lengths diversity panels and biparental populations. The program analyzes DNA fragment lengths generated in Applied Biosystems® (ABI) either manually or automatically by providing panels or bins. The package contains additional tools for converting the allele calls to GenAlEx, JoinMap® and OneMap software formats mainly used for genetic diversity and generating linkage maps in plant and animal populations. Easy plotting functions and multiplexing friendly capabilities are some of the strengths of this R package. Fragment analysis using a unique set of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) genotypes based on microsatellite markers is used to highlight the capabilities of Fragman.
Conclusion: Fragman is a valuable new tool for genetic analysis. The package produces equivalent results to other popular software for fragment analysis while possessing unique advantages and the possibility of automation for high-throughput experiments by exploiting the power of R.},

Thus, efﬁcient detection of null alleles is crucial, but the methods available for indirect null allele detection return inconsistent results. Here, our aim was to compare different methods for null allele detection, to explain their respective performance and to provide improvements. We applied several approaches to identify the ‘true’ null alleles based on the predictions made by ﬁve different methods, used either individually or in combination. First, we introduced simulated ‘true’ null alleles into 240 population data sets and applied the methods to measure their success in detecting the simulated null alleles. The single best-performing method was ML-NullFreq\_frequency. Furthermore, we applied different noise reduction approaches to improve the results. For instance, by combining the results of several methods, we obtained more reliable results than using a single one. Rule-based classiﬁcation was applied to identify population properties linked to the false discovery rate. Rules obtained from the classiﬁer described which population genetic estimates and loci characteristics were linked to the success of each method. We have shown that by simulating ‘true’ null alleles into a population data set, we may deﬁne a null allele frequency threshold, related to a desired true or false discovery rate. Moreover, using such simulated data sets, the expected null allele homozygote frequency may be estimated independently of the equilibrium state of the population.},

For each sample size, 100 resampled subsets were randomly drawn (without replacement).

The resampled subsets were also used to calculate main genetic diversity parameters and their variances to be used as a measure of accuracy of sampling. The results showed that at the 95 \% probability level, the sample sizes of 20-25 and 65-80 individuals were large enough to capture all the alleles at frequency above 0.05 and 0.01-0.05, respectively. 300-350 individuals were required to sample the alleles at frequencies below 0.01 at the 95 \% probability.

  abstract = {A significant portion of ongoing epigenetic research involves the investigation of DNA methylation and chromatin modification patterns seen throughout many biological processes. Over the last few years, epigenetic research has undergone a gradual shift and recent studies have been directed toward a genome-wide assessment. DNA methylation and chromatin modifications are essential components of the regulation of gene activity. DNA methylation effectively down-regulates gene activity by addition of a methyl group to the five-carbon of a cytosine base. Less specifically, modification of the chromatin structure can be carried out by multiple mechanisms leading to either the upregulation or down-regulation of the associated gene. Of the many assays used to assess the effects of epigenetic modifications, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which serves to monitor changes in chromatin structure, and bisulfite modification, which tracks changes in DNA methylation, are the two most commonly used techniques.},

  title = {Use of {{DNA}}-Markers for Tracing Illegal Logging},
  abstract = {Illegal logging is one of the main reasons of deforestation in natural forests and is the cause of high ecological and economic damage. Genetic methods are useful to infer species identity and are promising tools to control the geographic origin of logged timber. DNA barcoding and multilocus approaches using nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites as well as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) are the main methods in use to determine species identity. Due to recolonisation after the last glacial periods and limited pollen and seed dispersal we observe a spatial genetic structure for most species in natural forests. Genetic inventories with extensive and systematic samples over the whole species distribution area are the basis to identify the country of timber origin. In order to control for the origin of timber on the level of a logging concessions genetic inventories with a higher spatial resolution are needed. DNA extracted from wood generally is degraded in comparison to that from fresh leaf material. Thus for the practical application only gene markers that can be easily amplified in DNA extracted from unprocessed and processed timber are usable for geographic timber tracking. This has been sucessfully tested for microsatellites (cpSSRs, nSSRs) with amplified DNA fragments usually not larger than 500 bp. The power and possible spatial resolution of gene markers to identify the geographic origin of timber depends on the spatial genetic structure in the species distribution area and the quality of the genetic reference data base (the number and distribution of sampled populations, sample size within each sampled population) and the geographic distance between the geographic origin of the unknown timber probe and the next sampled population in the reference data base. Here computer simulations are very useful to design suitable sample strategies for timber tracking.},

  abstract = {Several Abies species are currently present in the Mediterranean region and most of them are endemic taxa and tertiary relicts. Using six nuclear microsatellites, we studied the genetic structure and interspeciﬁc relationships among West Mediterranean ﬁrs, A. pinsapo (Spain), A. maroccana and A. tazaotana (Morocco). Based on the hypothesis that A. pinsapo could historically exchange genes with A. alba growing in the Pyrenees via secondary contact, we investigated the level of genetic admixture between these species using a Bayesian approach. The studied populations showed moderate genetic diversity (mean HE = 0.598) and a high level of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.225) that was especially pronounced between A. alba and the African ﬁrs. All populations experienced a strong bottleneck effect that was likely induced by climatic changes occurring in the West Mediterranean during the last glacial cycle and the Holocene. According to Bayesian clustering, both African taxa grouped together in a single cluster, the two A. pinsapo populations formed a second cluster, and two additional clusters were detected within A. alba. Our results indicate that A. tazaotana is genetically very close to A. maroccana, and hence these two taxa should probably not be considered as separate species. We found no genetic admixture between A. pinsapo and A. alba and only minor between A. pinsapo and the African ﬁr populations suggesting an isolation effect of the Gibraltar Strait. Current limited distributions of ﬁrs in the Mediterranean region together with changing climate may lead to further deterioration of the genetic diversity levels. Hence, future efforts should focus on monitoring the demography and genetic threats to existing populations. ã 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

However, few studies test the applicability of those strategies to forest management. This paper uses a real forest health incident to assess the ability of forest management strategies to affect ecological and economic resilience of the forest. Two landscape scale strategies are compared to business as usual management for their ability to increase resilience to a climate-change induced mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Kamloops Timber Supply Area, British Columbia, Canada for the period 1980 to 2060. Proactive management to reduce high risk species while maintaining or increasing diversity through reforestation was found to be more resilient in terms of the metrics: post-disturbance growing stock, improved volume and stability of timber ﬂow, and net revenue. However, landscape-scale indicators of diversity were little affected by management. Our results were robust to uncertainty in tree growth rates and timber value and show that adapting to climate change through improving the resilience of forested landscapes is an economically viable option.},

Once this decision is taken, a genome project requires careful planning with respect to the organism involved and the intended quality of the genome draft.

  abstract = {Mediterranean islands have served as important Tertiary and glacial refuges, hosting important peripheral and ecologically marginal forest tree populations. These populations, presumably harboring unique gene complexes, are particularly interesting in the context of climate change. Pinus brutia Ten. is widespread in the eastern Mediterranean Basin and in Cyprus in particular it is the most common tree species. This study evaluated genetic patterns and morphoanatomical local adaptation along the species geographical distribution and altitudinal range in Cyprus. Analysis showed that the Cyprus population of P. brutia is a peripheral population with high genetic diversity, comprised of different subpopulations. Evidence suggests the presence of ongoing dynamic evolutionary processes among the different subpopulations, while the most relic and isolated subpopulations exhibited a decreased genetic diversity compared to the most compact subpopulations in the central area of the island. These results could be the consequence of the small size and prolonged isolation of the former. Comparing populations along an altitude gradient, higher genetic diversity was detected at the middle level. The phenotypic plasticity observed is particularly important for the adaptive potential of P. brutia in an island environment, since it allows rapid change in local environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Eﬀective population size (Ne) is a central concept in evolutionary biology and conservation genetics. It predicts rates of loss of neutral genetic variation, ﬁxation of deleterious and favourable alleles, and the increase of inbreeding experienced by a population. A method exists for the estimation of Ne from the observed linkage disequilibrium between unlinked loci in a population sample. While an increasing number of studies have applied this method in natural and managed populations, its reliability has not yet been evaluated. We developed a computer program to calculate this estimator of Ne using the most widely used linkage disequilibrium algorithm and used simulations to show that this estimator is strongly biased when the sample size is small ($<$100) and below the true Ne. This is probably due to the linkage disequilibrium generated by the sampling process itself and the inadequate correction for this phenomenon in the method. Results suggest that Ne estimates derived using this method should be regarded with caution in many cases. To improve the method’s reliability and usefulness we propose a way to determine whether a given sample size exceeds the population Ne and can therefore be used for the computation of an unbiased estimate.},

Frequent Pleistocene contacts between the two species could have contributed to the individualization of A. equi trojani and given rise to the particular morphology of the south-eastern ecotypes ofA. alba. In the western part of the basin, A. cephalonica populations would have appeared.},

Population genetic parameters and statistics show overall levels of genetic diversity and differentiation lower in Juglans regia than in other widespread plant species, outlining a significant amount of genetic erosion suffered by this species, mainly in Europe. The levels of differentiation among European and Asiatic populations, higher than those among European populations, support the thesis of a native origin of European walnut in postglacial times. The closeness to the HW equilibriumand the high levels of heterozygosity and intrapopulationdifferentiation, found in all the populations, show the capability of the species to avoid self-pollination and inbreeding. The occurrence of some different alleles among European and Asiatic populations provides an interesting item for programs of recovering and conservation of the genetic variability in this endangered widespread species.},

  abstract = {Enhancing species resilience to changing environmental conditions is often suggested as a climate change adaptation strategy. To effectively achieve this, it is necessary ﬁrst to understand the factors that determine species resilience, and their relative importance in shaping the ability of species to adjust to the complexities of environmental change. This is an extremely challenging task because it requires comprehensive information on species traits. We explored the resilience of 58 marine turtle regional management units (RMUs) to climate change, encompassing all seven species of marine turtles worldwide. We used expert opinion from the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group (n = 33 respondents) to develop a Resilience Index, which considered qualitative characteristics of each RMU (relative population size, rookery vulnerability, and genetic diversity) and non climate-related threats (ﬁsheries, take, coastal development, and pollution/pathogens). Our expert panel perceived rookery vulnerability (the likelihood of functional rookeries becoming extirpated) and non climate-related threats as having the greatest inﬂuence on resilience of RMUs to climate change. We identiﬁed the world’s 13 least resilient marine turtle RMUs to climate change, which are distributed within all three major ocean basins and include six of the world’s seven species of marine turtle. Our study provides the ﬁrst look at inter- and intra-species variation in resilience to climate change and highlights the need to devise metrics that measure resilience directly. We suggest that this approach can be widely used to help prioritize future actions that increase species resilience to climate change.},

  abstract = {Managers and conservationists often need to prioritize which impacts from climate change to deal with from a long list of threats. However, data which allows comparison of the relative impact from climatic threats for decision-making is often unavailable. This is the case for the management of sea turtles in the face of climate change. The terrestrial life stages of sea turtles can be negatively impacted by various climatic processes, such as sea level rise, altered cyclonic activity, and increased sand temperatures. However, no study has systematically investigated the relative impact of each of these climatic processes, making it challenging for managers to prioritize their decisions and resources. To address this we offer a systematic method for eliciting expert knowledge to estimate the relative impact of climatic processes on sea turtles’ terrestrial reproductive phase. For this we used as an example the world’s largest population of green sea turtles and asked 22 scientists and managers to answer a paper based survey with a series of pair-wise comparison matrices that compared the anticipated impacts from each climatic process. Both scientists and managers agreed that increased sand temperature will likely cause the most threat to the reproductive output of the nGBR green turtle population followed by sea level rise, then altered cyclonic activity. The methodology used proved useful to determine the relative impact of the selected climatic processes on sea turtles’ reproductive output and provided valuable information for decision-making. Thus, the methodological approach can potentially be applied to other species and ecosystems of management concern.},

  abstract = {The estimation of population allele frequencies using sample data forms a central component of studies in population genetics. These estimates can be used to test hypotheses on the evolutionary processes governing changes in genetic variation among populations. However, existing studies frequently do not account for sampling uncertainty in these estimates, thus compromising their utility. Incorporation of this uncertainty has been hindered by the lack of a method for constructing confidence intervals containing the population allele frequencies, for the general case of sampling from a finite diploid population of any size. In this study, we address this important knowledge gap by presenting a rigorous mathematical method to construct such confidence intervals. For a range of scenarios, the method is used to demonstrate that for a particular allele, in order to obtain accurate estimates within 0.05 of the population allele frequency with high probability (§95\%), a sample size of w30 is often required. This analysis is augmented by an application of the method to empirical sample allele frequency data for two populations of the checkerspot butterfly (Melitaea cinxia L.), occupying meadows in Finland. For each population, the method is used to derive §98:3\% confidence intervals for the population frequencies of three alleles. These intervals are then used to construct two joint §95\% confidence regions, one for the set of three frequencies for each population. These regions are then used to derive a §95\% confidence interval for Jost’s D, a measure of genetic differentiation between the two populations. Overall, the results demonstrate the practical utility of the method with respect to informing sampling design and accounting for sampling uncertainty in studies of population genetics, important for scientific hypothesis-testing and also for risk-based natural resource management.},

These proposals are intended for use in guiding tropical forest management but the indicators and verifiers we describe are not in the form of simple prescriptions where a single measurement can be recommended for a single causal effect. Since genetic dynamics operate at a different time and spatial scale than the events that can be observed at the level of forest stand effects, a single forest stand event can have effects on several genetic processes. In addition, the pattern of genetic diversity that has already evolved is due to a balance of several evolutionary forces that operate at different spatial and temporal scales and forest practices would therefore be expected to affect several genetic factors. To provide guidance on what genetic processes may be affected by forest practices, we therefore first describe the factors that affect genetic processes and then provide a matrix of relationships between types of forest level events and genetically significant factors.},

Herein, we evaluate the utility of the plastid trnL marker for species identification applied to Mediterranean pines (Pinus spp.). Our results indicate that trnL is a very sensitive marker for delimiting species biodiversity. Furthermore, High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis was exploited as a molecular fingerprint for fast and accurate discrimination of Pinus spp. DNA sequence variants. The trnL approach and the HRM analyses were extended to wood samples of two species (Pinus nigra and Pinus sylvestris) with excellent results, congruent to those obtained using leaf tissue. Both analyses demonstrate that hybrids from the P. brutia (maternal parent) 6 P. halepensis (paternal parent) cross, exhibit the P. halepensis profile, confirming paternal plastid inheritance in Group Halepensis pines. Our study indicates that a single one-step reaction method and DNA marker are sufficient for the identification of Mediterranean pines, their hybrids and the origin of pine wood. Furthermore, our results underline the potential for certain DNA regions to be used as novel biological information markers combined with existing morphological characters and suggest a relatively reliable and open taxonomic system that can link DNA variation to phenotype-based species or hybrid assignment status and direct taxa identification from recalcitrant tissues such as wood samples.},

Indicators are needed to tackle this task and must be based on scientiﬁcally valid relationships concerning different levels of biodiversity. In addition, indicators must provide tangible goals for forest policy and other relevant stakeholders. Here, we propose a single aggregated measure – the Austrian Forest Biodiversity Index (AFBI) – which is composed of different indicator values being weighed depending on their signiﬁcance for the maintenance of forest species richness and genetic diversity. The AFBI consists of nine state and four response indicators. Selection of state indicators was based on the general hypothesis that forests which mimic natural conditions or are characterised by structural elements of old-growth forests maintain a high number of forest dependent species and a high genetic richness therein. Among the response indicators we considered the establishment of natural forest reserves, genetic reserve forests, seed stands and seed orchards as most relevant. Proposed operational tools, especially for state indicators, are mainly based on the Austrian forest inventory. The sum of all weighted indicator measures is rescaled as a total score that may vary from 0 to 100, so that the AFBI is simple to communicate and straightforward to apply. The AFBI gives certain weight to genetic parameters which are often neglected in previous approaches.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary responses are required for tree populations to be able to track climate change. Results of 250 years of common garden experiments show that most forest trees have evolved local adaptation, as evidenced by the adaptive differentiation of populations in quantitative traits, reﬂecting environmental conditions of population origins. On the basis of the patterns of quantitative variation for 19 adaptation-related traits studied in 59 tree species (mostly temperate and boreal species from the Northern hemisphere), we found that genetic differentiation between populations and clinal variation along environmental gradients were very common (respectively, 90\% and 78\% of cases). Thus, responding to climate change will likely require that the quantitative traits of populations again match their environments. We examine what kind of information is needed for evaluating the potential to respond, and what information is already available. We review the genetic models related to selection responses, and what is known currently about the genetic basis of the traits. We address special problems to be found at the range margins, and highlight the need for more modeling to understand speciﬁc issues at southern and northern margins. We need new common garden experiments for less known species. For extensively studied species, new experiments are needed outside the current ranges. Improving genomic information will allow better prediction of responses. Competitive and other interactions within species and interactions between species deserve more consideration. Despite the long generation times, the strong background in quantitative genetics and growing genomic resources make forest trees useful species for climate change research. The greatest adaptive response is expected when populations are large, have high genetic variability, selection is strong, and there is ecological opportunity for establishment of better adapted genotypes.},

  abstract = {Forest trees have gained much attention in recent years as nonclassical model eukaryotes for population, evolutionary and ecological genomic studies. Because of low domestication, large open-pollinated native populations, and high levels of both genetic and phenotypic variation, they are ideal organisms to unveil the molecular basis of population adaptive divergence in nature. Population genomics, in its broadsense deﬁnition, is an emerging discipline that combines genome-wide sampling with traditional population genetic approaches to understanding evolution. Here we brieﬂy review traditional methods of studying adaptive genetic variation in forest trees, and describe a new, integrated population genomics approach. First, alleles (haplotypes) at candidate genes for adaptive traits and their effects on phenotypes need to be characterized via sequencing and association mapping. At this stage, functional genomics can assist in understanding gene action and regulation by providing detailed transcriptional proﬁles. Second, frequencies of alleles in native populations for causative single-nucleotide polymorphisms are estimated to identify patterns of adaptive variation across heterogeneous environments. Population genomics, through deciphering allelic effects on phenotypes and identifying patterns of adaptive variation at the landscape level, will in the future constitute a useful tool, if cost-effective, to design conservation strategies for forest trees.},

Reforestation programs were carried out in degraded areas by planting pines. Presently, the spontaneous regeneration of other species is scarce and species diversity is poor. Introducing woody resprouter species under pine forests would increase species diversity and ecosystem resilience to cope with different types of disturbances, such as wildﬁres. In this study, we investigated the survival, growth and functional responses of six Mediterranean trees and shrub resprouter species planted under pine forests. Experiments were done in a dry Mesomediterranean climate. Seedlings from a wide array of early to late successional trees and shrub species were outplanted in different pine densities, low, medium and high, which corresponded to 22\%, 48\% and 62\% of the maximum sunlight received, respectively. The time course of survival and growth (height and basal diameter) were analyzed for 3 years after outplanting. Survival was higher than 78\%, although differences between species and pine densities were found. Seedling growth also reﬂected different interactions among introduced seedlings and density of pines. Water use efﬁciency of species based on isotopic determinations (d13C and d18O) differed between densities and species according to functional groups. These results have relevant implications for the management and restoration of ﬁre-prone Mediterranean pine forests.},

  abstract = {Plants have developed intricate mechanisms involving gene regulatory systems to adjust to stresses. Phenotypic variation in plants under stress is classically attributed to DNA sequence variants. More recently, it was found that epigenetic modiﬁcations – DNA methylation-, chromatin- and small RNA-based mechanisms –can contribute separately or together to phenotypes by regulating gene expression in response to the stress effect. These epigenetic modiﬁcations constitute an additional layer of complexity to heritable phenotypic variation and the evolutionary potential of natural plant populations because they can affect ﬁtness. Natural populations can show differences in performance when they are exposed to changes in environmental conditions, partly because of their genetic variation but also because of their epigenetic variation. The line between these two components is blurred because little is known about the contribution of genotypes and epigenotypes to stress tolerance in natural populations. Recent insights in this ﬁeld have just begun to shed light on the behavior of genetic and epigenetic variation in natural plant populations under biotic and abiotic stresses.

  abstract = {There is a general trend of biodiversity loss at global, regional, national and local levels. To monitor this trend, international policy processes have created a wealth of indicators over the last two decades. However, genetic diversity indicators are regrettably absent from comprehensive bio-monitoring schemes. Here, we provide a review and an assessment of the different attempts made to provide such indicators for tree genetic diversity from the global level down to the level of the management unit. So far, no generally accepted indicators have been provided as international standards, nor tested for their possible use in practice. We suggest that indicators for monitoring genetic diversity and dynamics should be based on ecological and demographic surrogates of adaptive diversity as well as genetic markers capable of identifying genetic erosion and gene ﬂow. A comparison of past and present genecological distributions (patterns of genetic variation of key adaptive traits in the ecological space) of selected species is a realistic way of assessing the trend of intra-speciﬁc variation, and thus provides a state indicator of tree genetic diversity also able to reﬂect possible pressures threatening genetic diversity. Revealing beneﬁts of genetic diversity related to ecosystem services is complex, but current trends in plantation performance offer the possibility of an indicator of beneﬁt. Response indicators are generally much easier to deﬁne, because recognition and even quantiﬁcation of, e.g. research, education, breeding, conservation, and regulation actions and programs are relatively straightforward. Only state indicators can reveal genetic patterns and processes, which are fundamental for maintaining genetic diversity. Indirect indicators of pressure, beneﬁt, or response should therefore not be used independently of state indicators. A coherent set of indicators covering diversity–productivity–knowledge–management based on the genecological approach is proposed for application on appropriate groups of tree species in the wild and in cultivation worldwide. These indicators realistically reﬂect the state, trends and potentials of the world’s tree genetic resources to support sustainable growth. The state of the genetic diversity will be based on trends in species population distribution and diversity patterns for selected species. The productivity of the genetic resource of trees in current use will reﬂect the possible potential of mobilizing the resource further. Trends in knowledge will underpin the potential capacity for development of the resource and current management of the genetic resource itself will reveal how well we are actually doing and where improvements are required.

  abstract = {Allelic richness (number of alleles) is a measure of genetic diversity indicative of a population’s long-term potential for adaptability and persistence. It is used less commonly than heterozygosity as a genetic diversity measure, partially because it is more mathematically difficult to take into account the stochastic process of genetic drift for allelic richness. This paper presents a stochastic model for the allelic richness of a newly founded population experiencing genetic drift and gene flow. The model follows the dynamics of alleles lost during the founder event and simulates the effect of gene flow on maintenance and recovery of allelic richness. The probability of an allele’s presence in the population was identified as the relevant statistical property for a meaningful interpretation of allelic richness. A method is discussed that combines the probability of allele presence with a population’s allele frequency spectrum to provide predictions for allele recovery. The model’s analysis provides insights into the dynamics of allelic richness following a founder event, taking into account gene flow and the allele frequency spectrum. Furthermore, the model indicates that the ‘‘One Migrant per Generation’’ rule, a commonly used conservation guideline related to heterozygosity, may be inadequate for addressing preservation of diversity at the allelic level. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between heterozygosity and allelic richness as measures of genetic diversity, since focusing merely on the preservation of heterozygosity might not be enough to adequately preserve allelic richness, which is crucial for species persistence and evolution.},

Least upper bounds for this probability, in cases where only the allelic frequencies or the minimum allelic frequency a is known, have been found and the correspondence of these bounds to the situation of sampling of gametes rather than genotypes has been pointed out. It has been proved that the latter bound is also the least upper bound of the probability of losing at least one of the alleles with frequencies Bea in a sample of genotypes or gametes if neither the number of alleles in the population nor the genotypic frequencies are known.

The main goals of the present study were: i) to investigate/measure the epigenetic diversity of the poplar populations by determining their DNA methylation status; ii) to assess if and how methylation status influences population clustering; iii) to shed light on the changes that occur in the epigenome of ramets of the same poplar clone. To these purposes, 83 white poplar trees were sampled at different locations on the island of Sardinia. Methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism analysis was carried out on the genomic DNA extracted from leaves at the same juvenile stage. The study showed that the genetic biodiversity of poplars is quite limited but it is counterbalanced by epigenetic inter-population molecular variability. The comparison between MspI and HpaII DNA fragmentation profiles revealed that environmental conditions strongly influence hemi-methylation of the inner cytosine. The variable epigenetic status of Sardinian white poplars revealed a decreased number of population clusters. Landscape genetics analyses clearly demonstrated that ramets of the same clone were differentially methylated in relation to their geographic position. Therefore, our data support the notion that studies on plant biodiversity should no longer be restricted to genetic aspects, especially in the case of vegetatively propagated plant species.},

Numerous potential benefits are used to justify these planting campaigns. However, reports of poor tree survival raise questions about the ability of such projects to deliver on their promises over the long-term. Each potential benefit requires different supporting conditions—relating not only to the type and placement of the tree, but also to the broader urban system within which it is embedded. This set of supporting conditions may not always be mutually compatible and may not persist for the lifetime of the tree. Here, we demonstrate a systems-based approach that makes these dependencies, synergies, and tensions more explicit, allowing them to be used to test the decadal-scale resilience of urban street trees. Our analysis highlights social, environmental, and economic assumptions that are implicit within planting projects; notably that high levels of maintenance and public support for urban street trees will persist throughout their natural lifespan, and that the surrounding built form will remain largely unchanged. Whilst the vulnerability of each benefit may be highly context specific, we identify approaches that address some typical weaknesses, making a functional, resilient, urban forest more attainable.},

  abstract = {One of the most common questions asked before starting a new population genetic study using microsatellite allele frequencies is ‘‘how many individuals do I need to sample from each population?’’ This question has previously been answered by addressing how many individuals are needed to detect all of the alleles present in a population (i.e. rarefaction based analyses). However, we argue that obtaining accurate allele frequencies and accurate estimates of diversity are much more important than detecting all of the alleles, given that very rare alleles (i.e. new mutations) are not very informative for assessing genetic diversity within a population or genetic structure among populations. Here we present a comparison of allele frequencies, expected heterozygosities and genetic distances between real and simulated populations by randomly subsampling 5–100 individuals from four empirical microsatellite genotype datasets (Formica lugubris, Sciurus vulgaris, Thalassarche melanophris, and Himantopus novaezelandia) to create 100 replicate datasets at each sample size. Despite differences in taxon (two birds, one mammal, one insect), population size, number of loci and polymorphism across loci, the degree of differences between simulated and empirical dataset allele frequencies, expected heterozygosities and pairwise FST values were almost identical among the four datasets at each sample size. Variability in allele frequency and expected heterozygosity among replicates decreased with increasing sample size, but these decreases were minimal above sample sizes of 25 to 30. Therefore, there appears to be little benefit in sampling more than 25 to 30 individuals per population for population genetic studies based on microsatellite allele frequencies.},

  shorttitle = {A New Approach to Modeling the Sediment Retention Service ({{InVEST}} 3.0)},
  abstract = {There is a growing call for ecosystem services models that are both simple and scientiﬁcally credible, in order to serve public and private sector decision-making processes. Sediment retention receives particular interest given the impact of this service on water quality. We developed a new version of the sediment retention model for the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) tool to address previous limitations and facilitate model uncertainty assessment. We tested the model in the Cape Fear basin, North Carolina (NC), performing sensitivity analyses and assessing its ability to detect the spatial variability in sediment retention service for eight subcatchments. The main advantages of the revised model include the use of spatiallyexplicit, globally available input data, and the explicit consideration of hydrological connectivity in the landscape. The sensitivity analyses in the study catchment identiﬁed the erosivity and erodibility factors, together with the cover factor for agricultural land as the most inﬂuential parameter for sediment export. Relative predictions, representing the spatial variability in sediment exports, were correctly represented by the model. Absolute sediment exports were also highly correlated with observations, although their interpretation for socioeconomic assessments is more uncertain without local knowledge of the dominant erosion processes. This work conﬁrms that the sediment connectivity approach used in the revised InVEST model has great potential to quantify the sediment retention service. Although resources to conduct model calibration and testing are typically scarce, these practices should be encouraged to improve model interpretation and for conﬁdent application in different decision-making contexts. Without calibration, the InVEST sediment model still provides relevant information for ecosystem services assessments, especially in decision contexts that involve ranking of sediment export areas, such as spatial prioritization of conservation, development or restoration activities, taking into account non-linear sediment responses to changes in land use.},

This gap in knowledge is hindering progress in the interpretation of natural epigenetic variation. By applying the methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MSAP) technique to paired plant-pollen (i.e., sporophyte-male gametophyte) DNA samples, and then comparing methylation patterns and epigenetic population differentiation in sporophytes and their descendant gametophytes, we investigated transgenerational constancy of epigenetic structure in three populations of the perennial herb Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae). Single-locus and multilocus analyses revealed extensive epigenetic differentiation between sporophyte populations. Locus-by-locus comparisons of methylation status in individual sporophytes and descendant gametophytes showed that ,75\% of epigenetic markers persisted unchanged through gametogenesis. In spite of some epigenetic reorganization taking place during gametogenesis, multilocus epigenetic differentiation between sporophyte populations was preserved in the subsequent gametophyte stage. In addition to illustrating the efficacy of applying the MSAP technique to paired plantpollen DNA samples to investigate epigenetic gametic inheritance in wild plants, this paper suggests that epigenetic differentiation between adult plant populations of H. foetidus is likely to persist across generations.},

Using these approaches we analyse structure and migrations in a grey wolf (Canis lupus) population in north-eastern Europe. We genotyped 16 microsatellite loci in 166 individuals sampled from the wolf population in Estonia and Latvia that has been under strong and continuous hunting pressure for decades. Our analysis demonstrated that this relatively small wolf population is represented by four genetic groups. We also used a novel methodological approach that uses linear interpolation to statistically test the spatial separation of genetic groups. The new method, which is capable of using program STRUCTURE output, can be applied widely in population genetics to reveal both core areas and areas of low significance for genetic groups. We also used a recently developed spatially explicit individual-based method DResD, and applied it for the first time to microsatellite data, revealing a migration corridor and barriers, and several contact zones.},

  abstract = {As habitat loss accelerates, there is pressing need to preserve plant genetic diversity in ex situ conservation collections. Population structure (i.e. subdivision), which is common in plants, may be an important consideration when planning such collections because it results in locally restricted alleles or traits, which have high conservation, ecological, or economic value. Nonetheless, common protocols for ex situ collections do not consider population structure. To help inform collection decisions, we utilize computer simulations with different levels of realistic hierarchical population structure to evaluate the expected performance of an array of sample sizes and several spatial distributions of sampled populations. We quantify how population structure affects the expected probability of capturing alleles (especially rare alleles). We also test the effect of family-level structure due to pollen pool composition (e.g., sibling clusters). Our ﬁndings suggest that when range-wide population structure exists, the spatial distribution of sampled populations is crucial: sampling one population per region (dispersed sampling) captured up to 175\% more alleles than sampling all populations in one region (constrained sampling), and nearly as much as sampling all existing populations. The spatial effect is strongest for poorly-connected (low gene ﬂow) species. Under realistic population structure, moderate sampling (25–30 individuals per population) from few but widely-spaced populations performs optimally; this differs from previous recommended guidelines that do not consider structure. There is smaller effect of the pollen pool composition on collection performance. We conclude that seed collection plans should incorporate spatial considerations, especially for poorly-connected taxa. Our simulation approach can be extended to particular species and other spatial patterns. We use the butternut tree as a case study for collection planning.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary adaptation drives biodiversity. So far, however, evolutionary thinking has had limited impact on plans to counter the effects of climate change on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. This is despite habitat fragmentation diminishing the ability of populations to mount evolutionary responses, via reductions in population size, reductions in gene flow and reductions in the heterogeneity of environments that populations occupy. Research on evolutionary adaptation to other challenges has benefitted enormously in recent years from genomic tools, but these have so far only been applied to the climate change issue in a piecemeal manner. Here, we explore how new genomic knowledge might be combined with evolutionary thinking in a decision framework aimed at reducing the long-term impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services. This framework highlights the need to rethink local conservation and management efforts in biodiversity conservation. We take a dynamic view of biodiversity based on the recognition of continuously evolving lineages, and we highlight when and where new genomic approaches are justified. In general, and despite challenges in developing genomic tools for non-model organisms, genomics can help management decide when resources should be redirected to increasing gene flow and hybridisation across climate zones and facilitating in situ evolutionary change in large heterogeneous areas. It can also help inform when conservation priorities need to shift from maintaining genetically distinct populations and species to supporting processes of evolutionary change. We illustrate our argument with particular reference to Australia’s biodiversity.},

The 19 selected microsatellite markers allowed the discrimination of the studied cultivars, with a total of 97 alleles detected and an average of 5 alleles per locus, confirming that these markers are more suitable tools for walnut identification than other molecular markers studied previously. The genetic similarity estimated from the molecular data clearly separated the Spanish walnuts from the Californian genotypes.

Three mitochondrial lineages were observed, one comprising Calabrian populations and two distributed in the Balkans, coinciding with A. alba and A. cephalonica. The boundary between lineages is sharp; only two populations containing a mixture of haplotypes were found. Bayesian analysis of population structure based on seven nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci revealed the existence of two clusters whose proportions exhibited a latitudinal cline with a width of 2.38 ($<$ 255 km). Populations in the center of the latitudinal cline exhibit the most symmetrical, the ﬂattest, and the broadest distributions of cluster proportions within individual tree genomes. A neighbor-net network reﬂects the cline resulting from the Bayesiananalysis. The observed variation patterns are not consistent with the hypothesis of A. borisii-regis as a monophyletic taxon or a stabilized hybridogenous species resulted from ancient hybridization; the taxon rather is a product of recent introgression.},

  title = {{{RTehseaerchPairnticules}} Taeda Genome Is Characterized by Diverse and Highly Diverged Repetitive Sequences},
  abstract = {Background: In today's age of genomic discovery, no attempt has been made to comprehensively sequence a gymnosperm genome. The largest genus in the coniferous family Pinaceae is Pinus, whose 110-120 species have extremely large genomes (c. 20-40 Gb, 2N = 24). The size and complexity of these genomes have prompted much speculation as to the feasibility of completing a conifer genome sequence. Conifer genomes are reputed to be highly repetitive, but there is little information available on the nature and identity of repetitive units in gymnosperms. The pines have extensive genetic resources, with approximately 329000 ESTs from eleven species and genetic maps in eight species, including a dense genetic map of the twelve linkage groups in Pinus taeda.
Results: We present here the Sanger sequence and annotation of ten P. taeda BAC clones and Genome Analyzer II whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences representing 7.5\% of the genome. Computational annotation of ten BACs predicts three putative protein-coding genes and at least fifteen likely pseudogenes in nearly one megabase of sequence. We found three conifer-specific LTR retroelements in the BACs, and tentatively identified at least 15 others based on evidence from the distantly related angiosperms. Alignment of WGS sequences to the BACs indicates that 80\% of BAC sequences have similar copies (≥ 75\% nucleotide identity) elsewhere in the genome, but only 23\% have identical copies (99\% identity). The three most common repetitive elements in the genome were identified and, when combined, represent less than 5\% of the genome.
Conclusions: This study indicates that the majority of repeats in the P. taeda genome are 'novel' and will therefore require additional BAC or genomic sequencing for accurate characterization. The pine genome contains a very large number of diverged and probably defunct repetitive elements. This study also provides new evidence that sequencing a pine genome using a WGS approach is a feasible goal.},

The variation observed within the last mentioned groups of firs was mainly due to the diferent restriction profiles of the gene in A. alba and A. nordmanniana species of the former region as well as owing to its heterogeneous nature in all the four species from North America. The RFLP data presented to far only partially correlate with the taxonomic status and hybridological relationships of the species concerned.},

Genetic monitoring is assumed to contribute essentially to the estimation and valuation of the effect of factors influencing the genetic system of trees in the forests, thus making it an early warning and controlling system for ecosystemic changes. The “Concept of a Genetic Monitoring for Forest Tree Species in the Federal Republic of Germany” gives scientifically-based guidelines for monitoring the current state and dynamics of genetic systems in forest stands of diverse tree species in an extensively, harmonized manner. Both objectives and the realization of the genetic monitoring concept are presented here. The status of the genetic systems of forest tree populations is assessed on the basis of criteria, indi cators and verifiers. For this purpose the genetic as well as the phenological and physiological levels are taken into consideration in order to follow temporal developments and to estimate influencing factors. The results of a pioneer study concerning the tree species Fagus sylvatica and Prunus avium are reported.},

We investigated the effect on selected mechanical properties of adding rice straw, rice husk and paper sludge to wood composites to replace wood particles for manufacturing green pallets. Results showed that increasing the contents of rice straw and rice husk dramatically decreased the mechanical strength of the composites. This is because the wax and silicate coating of these materials obstructed the strong bonding with UF resin. When 10 wt.\% of wood particle was replaced with 10 wt.\% of paper sludge, the wood–paper sludge composites showed similar mechanical properties to those of wood particle. Wood particle can be replaced by 10 wt.\% of dried paper sludge in accordance with the minimum requirement recommended by standards in green pallet manufacturing.},

The reduction of carbon dioxide production during the manufacture of cement is one of the major aims of the building industry. Therefore, the effect of using different binding agents in combination with hemp slices in composites was examined. Conventional binders (such as hydrated lime and cement) in hemp concrete were replaced by alternative materials such as MgO and zeolite. The experimental examination of selected mechanical properties indicated that using zeolite as a cement replacement does not appear to create mechanically stronger hemp concrete. On the other hand, the magnesium oxide-cement system, based on optimally milled magnesium oxide, appears to be a suitable replacement for cement in lightweight composites, which could lead to new environmental products such as non-load bearing building materials. Wood cellulose is another very interesting material as a possible reinforcement in cement; it is a biodegradable, renewable, inexpensive, readily available natural resource, and it contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gases.},

Forest management practices can affect diversity on various levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem. Understanding past natural disturbance dynamics and their level of dependence on human disturbances and management practices is essential for the conservation and management of FGR, especially in the light of climate change. In this review, forest management practices and their impact on genetic composition are reviewed, synthesized, and interpreted in the light of existing national and international forest monitoring schemes and concepts from various European projects. There is a clear need and mandate for forest genetic monitoring (FGM), while the requirements thereof lack complementarity with existing forest monitoring. Due to certain obstacles (e.g., the lack of uniﬁed FGM implementation procedures across the countries, high implementation costs, large number of indicators and veriﬁers for FGM proposed in the past), merging FGM with existing forest monitoring is complicated. Nevertheless, FGM is of paramount importance for forestry and the natural environment in the future, regardless of the presence or existence of other monitoring systems, as it provides information no other monitoring system can yield. FGM can provide information related to adaptive and neutral genetic diversity changes over time, on a species and/or on a population basis and can serve as an early warning system for the detection of potentially harmful changes of forest adaptability. In addition, FGM offers knowledge on the adaptive potential of forests under the changing environment, which is important for the long-term conservation of FGR.},

  abstract = {We have examined patterns of variation of several kinds of molecular markers (isozymes, RFLPs of ribosomal DNA and anonymous low-copy number DNA, RAPDs and microsatellites) and an adaptive trait [date of bud set in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)]. The study included Finnish Scots pine populations (from latitude 60\textasciitilde{} to 70\textasciitilde{} which experience a steep climatic gradient. Common garden experiments show that these populations are adapted to the location of their origin and genetically differentiated in adaptive quantitative traits, e.g. the date of bud set in first-year seedlings. In the northernmost population, bud set took place about 21 days earlier than in the southernmost population. Of the total variation in bud set, 36.4\% was found among the populations. All molecular markers showed high levels of within-population variation, while differentiation among populations was low. Among all the studied markers, microsatellites were the most variable (He=0.77). Differences between populations were small, GST was less than 0.02. Our study suggests that molecular markers may be poor predictors of the population differentiation of quantitative traits in Scots pine, as exemplified here by bud-set date.},

  abstract = {Epigenetics refers to heritable alterations in chromatin architecture that do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence but profoundly affect gene expression and impact cellular function. Epigenetic regulation is attained by specific mechanisms involving DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications and the action of noncoding (nc) RNAs which lead to open or closed chromatin states associated with gene activation or gene silencing, respectively. Over the past two decades extensive investigations have provided a wealth of information on epigenetic regulation at specific loci both in model and crop plants and the effect it may have on various aspects of plant development such as proper vegetative growth, successful reproduction and viability, effects on yield, and efficiency in coping with stress. In recent years, the rapid progress of high-throughput technologies has led to the unveiling of epigenetic landscapes at genome-wide scale (epigenomes) exemplified by the deciphering of the full methylomes, at single base resolution, of the model plant Arabidopsis and crop plants such as rice and tomato. An increasing number of epigenomes are now being investigated on crops of high economic value. Transgenerational natural or induced epigenetic variation can be a new source of phenotypic diversity especially for species with low genetic variation. The comparison of different epigenomes arising from different genotypes/tissues/cell types/environmental conditions can offer valuable information for the development of biomarkers paving the way to what is nowadays termed plant epibreeding. This review will attempt a comprehensive presentation of the progress in plant epigenetics both at small scale (single locus) and large scale (epigenome-wide) during development and in response to environmental stress, focusing on agronomically important crops and the impact that epigenetics, epigenomics and the new emerging field of epibreeding may have on crop improvement.},

Furthermore, few tools exist that are specifically designed for analyzing data from clonal populations, making analysis difficult and haphazard. We developed the R package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and can be analyzed on a userdefined hierarchy that includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions include calculation of Bruvo’s distance for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations. A manual with documentation and examples is provided. Poppr is open source and major releases are available on CRAN: http://cran. r-project.org/package=poppr.

  abstract = {GST and its relatives are often interpreted as measures of differentiation between subpopulations, with values near zero supposedly indicating low differentiation. However, GST necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model.},

  abstract = {Background: The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations.
Results: We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza.
Conclusions: Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets.},

However, it is difficult or impossible to distinguish A. sinensis from other species of the genus Aquilaria Lam. and its closely related genus Gyrinops Gaertn. based on wood anatomical characteristics. Probably, DNA barcoding technology might provide an improvement in species identification. In this study, wood samples were tested, which were submitted to high-temperature drying and were stored for a long period in a xylarium. The factors should be identified that hinder the efficiency of wood DNA extraction from this species. The results indicate that the DNA from the wood tissues could be successfully amplified, apart from some DNA regions from the heartwood of the dried samples and the xylarium samples. The DNA sequences from the wood tissues mostly matched with the sequences of A. sinensis deposited in the GenBank. Moreover, analyses of phylogenetic trees based on trnL-trnF and ITS1 regions indicated that the wood tissues in the tests clustered together with the A. sinensis species from the GenBank, with bootstrap values of 74\% and 94\%, respectively. Consequently, it is feasible to identify A. sinensis wood on a species level based on the DNA barcoding technology.},

  abstract = {Background: Changes in DNA methylation have been associated with traffic-related air pollution in observational studies, but the specific mechanisms and temporal dynamics therein have not been explored in a controlled study of asthmatics. In this study, we investigate short-term effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on DNA methylation levels at CpG sites across the genome in circulating blood in asthmatics.
Methods: A double-blind crossover study of filtered air and diesel exhaust exposures was performed on sixteen non-smoking asthmatic subjects. Blood samples were collected pre-exposure, and then 6 and 30 hours post-exposure. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA methylation was interrogated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Array. Exposure-related changes in DNA methylation were identified. In addition, CpG sites overlapping with Alu or LINE1 repetitive elements and candidate microRNA loci were also analyzed.
Results: DNA methylation at 2827 CpG sites were affected by exposure to diesel exhaust but not filtered air; these sites enriched for genes involved in protein kinase and NFkB pathways. CpG sites with significant changes in response to diesel exhaust exposure primarily became less methylated, with a site residing within GSTP1 being among the significant hits. Diesel exhaust-associated change was also found for CpG sites overlapping with Alu and LINE1 elements as well as for a site within miR-21.
Conclusion: Short-term exposure to diesel exhaust resulted in DNA methylation changes at CpG sites residing in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress response, repetitive elements, and microRNA. This provides plausibility for the role of DNA methylation in pathways by which airborne particulate matter impacts gene expression and offers support for including DNA methylation analysis in future efforts to understand the interactions between environmental exposures and biological systems.},

Relation between genetic diversity and mass production of forest reproductive material is discussed in a holistic manner. In indus trial forest plantations, narrow genetic diversity is desirable and reproductive material is produced at clone level. On the other hand, in conservation forestry a wide genetic diversity is imperative. Beside management goals, a desirable level of genetic diversity is related to rotation cycle and ontogeny of tree species. Risks of failure are lower in short rotations of fast growing species. In production of slow growing species, managed in long rotations, the reduction of genetic diversity increases the risk of failure due to causes unknown or unexpected at the time of planting. This risk is additionally increased in cases of seed transfer and in conditions of climate change. Every step in production of forest reproductive material, from collection to nursery production, has an effect on genetic diversity mainly by directional selection and should be considered. This review revealed no consistent decrease of genetic diversity dur ing forest reproductive material production and planting.},

At each site, trees were sampled from three distinct management types (domestication levels): naturalized stands, managed coppice, and grafted fruit orchards. In more than a third of the orchards, nonlocal genetic material (grafted clones) were evident, showing (as predicted) large differences from the other two domestication levels for most of the withinpopulation genetic diversity parameters estimated. Randomly generated linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed weak though significant differences in two-locus allelic correlations between naturalized stands and coppice, suggesting that long-term management techniques may influence the genetic makeup of the populations. Multivariate analysis revealed the existence of five distinct gene pools across the study area; three were located in Greece, one on the northwestern coast of the Iberian peninsula and a large gene pool covering the rest of the Mediterranean basin. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to developing conservation strategies for chestnut genetic resources in Europe.},

  abstract = {Domestication has been inﬂuenced by formal plant breeding since the onset of intensive agriculture and the Green Revolution. Despite providing food security for some regions, intensive agriculture has had substantial detrimental consequences for the environment and does not fulﬁll smallholder’s needs under most developing countries conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to look for alternative plant production techniques, effective for each environmental, socio-cultural, and economic conditions. This is particularly relevant for countries that are megadiverse and major centers of plant domestication and diversiﬁcation. In this white paper, a Mexico-centered initiative is proposed, with two main objectives: (1) to study, understand, conserve, and sustainably use the genetic diversity of domesticated plants and their wild relatives, as well as the ongoing evolutionary processes that generate and maintain it; and (2) to strengthen food and forestry production in a socially fair and environmentally friendly way. To fulﬁll these objectives, the initiative focuses on the source of variability available for domestication (genetic diversity and functional genomics), the context in which domestication acts (breeding and production) and one of its main challenges (environmental change). Research on these components can be framed to target and connect both the theoretical understanding of the evolutionary processes, the practical aspects of conservation, and food and forestry production. The target, main challenges, problems to be faced and key research questions are presented for each component, followed by a roadmap for the consolidation of this proposal as a national initiative.},

It is a nutrient-dense food mainly owing to its oil content (up to 740 g kg−1 in some commercial varieties), which can be extracted easily by screw pressing and consumed without reﬁning. Walnut oil composition is dominated largely by unsaturated fatty acids (mainly linoleic together with lesser amounts of oleic and linolenic acids). Minor components of walnut oil include tocopherols, phospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, hydrocarbons and volatile compounds. Phenolic compounds, present at high levels in the seed coat but poorly extracted with the oil, have been extensively characterised and found to possess strong antioxidant properties. The oil extraction residue is rich in proteins (unusually high in arginine, glutamic and aspartic acids) and has been employed in the formulation of various functional food products. This review describes current scientiﬁc knowledge concerning walnut genetic resources and composition as well as by-product obtainment and characteristics.},

Mutually orthogonal directions (called factor axes) along which intersequence variance is greatest are defined in this hyperspace. Projection of the sequences onto planes defined by these factorial directions reveals clustering of species that is suggestive of phylogenetic relationships. For each factorial direction, correspondence analysis points to regions of "importance," i.e., those base positions at which the systematic changes occur that define that particular direction. In effect, the technique provides a rapid determination of group-specific signatures. In several instances, similarities between sequences are indicated that have only recently been inferred from visual base-to-base comparisons. These results suggest that correspondence analysis may provide a valuable starting point from which to uncover the patterns of change underlying the evolution ofa macromolecule, such as 5S RNA.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence shows that epigenetics plays an important role in phenotypic variance. However, little is known about epigenetic variation in the important ornamental tree Prunus mume. We used ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive ampliﬁed polymorphism (MSAP) techniques, and association analysis and sequencing to investigate epigenetic variation and its relationships with genetic variance, environment factors, and traits. By performing leaf sampling, the relative total methylation level (29.80\%) was detected in 96 accessions of P. mume. And the relative hemi-methylation level (15.77\%) was higher than the relative full methylation level (14.03\%). The epigenetic diversity (I∗ = 0.575, h∗ = 0.393) was higher than the genetic diversity (I = 0.484, h = 0.319). The cultivated population displayed greater epigenetic diversity than the wild populations in both southwest and southeast China. We found that epigenetic variance and genetic variance, and environmental factors performed cooperative structures, respectively. In particular, leaf length, width and area were positively correlated with relative full methylation level and total methylation level, indicating that the DNA methylation level played a role in trait variation. In total, 203 AFLP and 423 MSAP associated markers were detected and 68 of them were sequenced. Homologous analysis and functional prediction suggested that the candidate markerlinked genes were essential for leaf morphology development and metabolism, implying that these markers play critical roles in the establishment of leaf length, width, area, and ratio of length to width.},

Recommendations for action arising from the SOW-FGR, which are captured in the ﬁrst Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources, and the above articles are discussed. These include: increasing the awareness of the importance of and threats to forest genetic resources and the mainstreaming of genetic considerations into forest management and restoration; establishing common garden provenance trials to support restoration and climate change initiatives that extend to currently little-researched tree species; streamlining processes for germplasm exchange internationally for research and development; and the intelligent use of modern molecular marker methods as genetic indicators in management and for improvement purposes.},

  abstract = {Contemporary forest planning has tasked managers with developing goals associated with resistance and resilience. In practice, silviculturists use forest structure and tree species composition to characterize goals and desired future conditions, write prescriptions, and monitor outcomes associated with resistance and resilience. Although rarely discussed in the exploding literature relating to forest resistance and resilience, silvicultural regeneration methods are important and underutilized tools to meet these goals. We propose alternative silvicultural systems for building resistance and resilience to two common large-scale bark beetle disturbance agents in the Intermountain West, United States: mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) and spruce beetle (Dendroctonus ruﬁpennis Kirby). Shelterwood, and shelterwood-with-reserves, silvicultural systems provide the desirable facilitative characteristics of a mature overstory on maintaining advance reproduction and the establishment of new cohorts of desirable tree species. These also allow the timely regeneration of large treatment areas necessary to rapidly promote desired future conditions in the face of inevitable disturbance. When implemented proactively, regeneration treatments allow silviculturists to take advantage of currently existing vegetation for the creation of age class and tree species diversity. In general, these examples illustrate the need for proactive planning for regeneration in response to any disturbance where desired future conditions include particular species. Furthermore, we argue that timely silvicultural interventions that focus on regenerating trees may be a key factor in achieving goals relating to resilience to speciﬁc disturbance types. Waiting until after the disturbance has occurred could result in the lost opportunity to establish desired species composition or stand structure—and may well result in a considerable restoration challenge.},

  abstract = {Although highly variable loci, such as microsatellite loci, are revolutionizing both evolutionary and conservation biology, data from these loci need to be carefully evaluated. First, because these loci often have very high within-population heterozygosity, the magnitude of differentiation measures may be quite small. For example, maximum GST values for populations with no common alleles at highly variable loci may be small and are at maximum less than the average within-population homozygosity. As a result, measures that are variation independent are recommended for highly variable loci. Second, bottlenecks or a reduction in population size can generate large genetic distances in a short time for these loci. In this case, the genetic distance may be corrected for low variation in a population and tests to detect bottlenecks are advised. Third, statistically significant differences may not reflect biologically meaningful differences both because the patterns of adaptive loci may not be correlated with highly variable loci and statistical power with these markers is so high. As an example of this latter effect, the statistical power to detect a one-generation bottleneck of different sizes for different numbers of highly variable loci is discussed. All of these concerns need to be incorporated in the utilization and interpretation of patterns of highly variable loci for both evolutionary and conservation biology.},

Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and ﬂoods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short–medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and ﬁre risks.},

The use of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows the development of molecular resources even for non-model species with complex genomes (i.e., complete genome and transcriptome sequencing, high numbers of neutral and putative functional markers, ESTSSRs, and SNPs).

  abstract = {Dynamic conservation of forest genetic resources (FGR) means maintaining the genetic diversity of trees within an evolutionary process and allowing generation turnover in the forest. We assessed the network of forests areas managed for the dynamic conservation of FGR (conservation units) across Europe (33 countries). On the basis of information available in the European Information System on FGR (EUFGIS Portal), species distribution maps, and environmental stratification of the continent, we developed ecogeographic indicators, a marginality index, and demographic indicators to assess and monitor forest conservation efforts. The pan-European network has 1967 conservation units, 2737 populations of target trees, and 86 species of target trees. We detected a poor coincidence between FGR conservation and other biodiversity conservation objectives within this network. We identified 2 complementary strategies: a species-oriented strategy in which national conservation networks are specifically designed for key target species and a site-oriented strategy in which multiple-target units include so-called secondary species conserved within a few sites. The network is highly unbalanced in terms of species representation, and 7 key target species are conserved in 60\% of the conservation units. We performed specific gap analyses for 11 tree species, including assessment of ecogeographic, demographic, and genetic criteria. For each species, we identified gaps, particularly in the marginal parts of their distribution range, and found multiple redundant conservation units in other areas. The Mediterranean forests and to a lesser extent the boreal forests are underrepresented. Monitoring the conservation efficiency of each unit remains challenging; however, $<$2\% of the conserved populations seem to be at risk of extinction. On the basis of our results, we recommend combining species-oriented and site-oriented strategies.},

  abstract = {Forest genetic resources are considered here in a global perspective, including both cultivated and wild populations. Human interference on global genetic resources results from the impact of different activities: (i) breeding and selection, (ii) seed transfer, (iii) plant population management activities, (iv) alteration of the environment. Expected genetic consequences of these activities were reviewed and revised according to the recent literature. Research on domestication in crop plants reveals that drastic selection can still retain a signiﬁcant level of genetic diversity including diversity of some genes involved in the selected traits. More important than the impact of breeding and selection in trees, the impact of seed transfer on the whole resource is complex, depending on the origin and genetic diversity of the transplanted material, as well as on the environmental conditions and genetic diversity of the local population in the destination site. Among silvicultural practices, the regeneration phase has a great potential for reducing genetic diversity, but various regeneration practices may result in high genetic diversity. Other treatments, like thinning, may also interfere with the demographic parameters which shape genetic diversity. Thus, different silvicultural systems will have different impacts on the genetic resources of target species but no simple ranking can be made in that respect. Attention should also be given to the genetic resources of non-target species which may be severely affected. Finally, a major impact is suspected from modiﬁcations in the biotic and abiotic environment: this should be further investigated. Monitoring the genetic resources globally requires the development of criteria and indicators: some recent research orientations serving this objective were listed.},

Aquilaria is a highly protected species due to the excessive exploitation of its precious agarwood. Here, we applied the DNA barcoding technique to generate barcode sequences for Aquilaria species and later applied the barcodes to identify the source species of agarwood found in the market. We developed a reference DNA barcode library using eight candidate barcode loci (matK, rbcL, rpoB, rpoC1, psbA-trnH, trnL-trnF, ITS, and ITS2) amplified from 24 leaf accessions of seven Aquilaria species obtained from living trees. Our results indicated that all single barcodes can be easily amplified and sequenced with the selected primers. The combination of trnL-trnF+ITS and trnL-trnF+ITS2 yielded the greatest species resolution using the least number of loci combination, while matK+trnLtrnF+ITS showed potential in detecting the geographical origins of Aquilaria species. We propose trnL-trnF+ITS2 as the best candidate barcode for Aquilaria as ITS2 has a shorter sequence length compared to ITS, which eases PCR amplification especially when using degraded DNA samples such as those extracted from processed agarwood products. A blind test conducted on eight agarwood samples in different forms using the proposed barcode combination proved successful in their identification up to the species level. Such potential of DNA barcoding in identifying the source species of agarwood will contribute to the international timber trade control, by providing an effective method for species identification and product authentication.},

  abstract = {Working with weakly congruent markers means that consensus genetic structuring of populations requires methods explicitly devoted to this purpose. The method, which is presented here, belongs to the multivariate analyses. This method consists of diﬀerent steps. First, single-marker analyses were performed using a version of principal component analysis, which is designed for allelic frequencies (\%PCA). Drawing conﬁdence ellipses around the population positions enhances \%PCA plots. Second, a multiple co-inertia analysis (MCOA) was performed, which reveals the common features of single-marker analyses, builds a reference structure and makes it possible to compare single-marker structures with this reference through graphical tools. Finally, a typological value is provided for each marker. The typological value measures the eﬃciency of a marker to structure populations in the same way as other markers. In this study, we evaluate the interest and the eﬃciency of this method applied to a European and African bovine microsatellite data set. The typological value diﬀers among markers, indicating that some markers are more eﬃcient in displaying a consensus typology than others. Moreover, eﬃcient markers in one collection of populations do not remain eﬃcient in others. The number of markers used in a study is not a suﬃcient criterion to judge its reliability. “Quantity is not quality”.},

The convention on biological diversity regards eVective monitoring as necessary to halt the ongoing erosion of biological variation, and such programs at the ecosystem and species levels are enforced in several countries. However, at the level of genetic biodiversity, little has been accomplished, and monitoring programs need to be developed. We deWne “conservation genetic monitoring” to imply the systematic, temporal study of genetic variation within particular species/populations with the aim to detect changes that indicate compromise or loss of such diversity. We also (i) identify basic starting points for conservation genetic monitoring, (ii) review the availability of such information using Sweden as an example, (iii) suggest categories of species for pilot monitoring programs, and (iv) identify some scientiWc and logistic issues that need to be addressed in the context of conservation genetic monitoring. We suggest that such programs are particularly warranted for species subject to large scale enhancement and harvest—operations that are known to potentially alter the genetic composition and reduce the variability of populations.},

This realization has prompted agreements by world leaders to conserve genetic diversity, and this is an explicit goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Nevertheless, very limited action has been taken to protect genetic diversity on a global scale. International conservation efforts to halt biodiversity loss focus on habitats and species, whereas little or no attention is paid to gene level variation. By this year, 2010, world leaders have agreed that a signiﬁcant reduction of the rate of biodiversity loss should have been achieved. However, gene level diversity is still not monitored, indicators that can help identify threats to genetic variation are missing, and there is no strategy for how genetic aspects can be included in biodiversity targets beyond 2010. Important ﬁndings and conclusions from decades of conservation genetic research are not translated into concrete conservation action in the arena of international policy development. There is an urgent need for conservation geneticists worldwide to become involved in policy and practical conservation work beyond the universities and research institutions.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic variation in natural populations with contrasting habitats might be an important element, in addition to the genetic variation, in plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we assessed genetic, epigenetic, and cytogenetic structure of the three Lilium bosniacum populations growing on distinct habitats. One population was growing under habitual ecological conditions for this species and the other two were growing under stress associated with high altitude and serpentine soil. Ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism and methylation-sensitive ampliﬁcation polymorphism analyses revealed that the three populations did not differentiate genetically, but were clearly separated in three distinct clusters according to DNA methylation proﬁles. Principal coordinate analysis showed that overall epigenetic variation was closely related to habitat conditions. A new methylation-sensitive ampliﬁcation polymorphism scoring approach allowed identiﬁcation of mainly unmethylated (/ST ¼ 0.190) and fully CpG methylated (/ST ¼ 0.118) subepiloci playing a role in overall population differentiation, in comparison with hemimethylated sites (/ST ¼ 0.073). In addition, unusual rDNA repatterning and the presence of B chromosomes bearing 5S rDNA loci were recorded in the population growing on serpentine soil, suggesting dynamic chromosome rearrangements probably linked to global genome demethylation, which might have reactivated some mobile elements. We discuss our results considering our earlier data on morphology and leaf anatomy of several L. bosniacum populations, and suggest a possible role of epigenetics as a key element in population differentiation associated with environmental stress in these particular lily populations.},

For example, international laws require timber identification and the control of the origin of forest reproductive material. In this paper, we present a mitochondrial DNA marker which can be used to differentiate among groups of fir species (Abies spp.). Eight Mediterranean and one North American fir species (used as reference) were analysed at the fourth intron of the NAD subunit 5 gene. A total of six different haplotypes was identified, one in the American Abies concolor, the other five in Mediterranean species. Two different haplotypes were found each in the widespread A. alba and in A. cephalonica, one haplotype being shared among the two species. A single species specific haplotype was found in the near-eastern A. cilicica. The two southwestern species A. pinsapo and A. numidica shared one haplotype. The fifth haplotype was shared by all remaining eastern Mediterranean firs, A. cephalonica, A. bornmuelleriana, A. equi-troiani, and A. nordmanniana. Differences in haplotype sequences were mainly due to large insertions/deletions. Agarose gel electrophoresis thus provides a fast, cheap and reliable diagnosis method for species or species group identification.},

  abstract = {Background: Walnut (Juglans regia, 2n = 32, approximately 606 Mb per 1C genome) is an economically important tree crop. Resistance to anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is a major objective of walnut genetic improvement in China. The recently developed specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is an efficient strategy that can obtain large numbers of markers with sufficient sequence information to construct high-density genetic maps and permits detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular breeding.
Results: SLAF-seq generated 161.64 M paired-end reads. 153,820 SLAF markers were obtained, of which 49,174 were polymorphic. 13,635 polymorphic markers were sorted into five segregation types and 2,577 markers of them were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 2,395 of these fell into 16 linkage groups (LGs) for the female map, 448 markers for the male map, and 2,577 markers for the integrated map. Taking into account the size of all LGs, the marker coverage was 2,664.36 cM for the female map, 1,305.58 cM for the male map, and 2,457.82 cM for the integrated map. The average intervals between two adjacent mapped markers were 1.11 cM, 2.91 cM and 0.95 cM for three maps, respectively. ‘SNP\_only’ markers accounted for 89.25 \% of the markers on the integrated map. Mapping markers contained 5,043 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci, which corresponded to two SNP loci per SLAF marker. According to the integrated map, we used interval mapping (Logarithm of odds, LOD $>$ 3.0) to detect our quantitative trait. One QTL was detected for anthracnose resistance. The interval of this QTL ranged from 165.51 cM to 176.33 cM on LG14, and ten markers in this interval that were above the threshold value were considered to be linked markers to the anthracnose resistance trait. The phenotypic variance explained by each marker ranged from 16.2 to 19.9 \%, and their LOD scores varied from 3.22 to 4.04.
Conclusions: High-density genetic maps for walnut containing 16 LGs were constructed using the SLAF-seq method with an F1 population. One QTL for walnut anthracnose resistance was identified based on the map. The results will aid molecular marker-assisted breeding and walnut resistance genes identification.},

  abstract = {Invasive plants have aroused attention globally for causing ecological damage and having a negative impact on the economy and human health. However, it can be extremely challenging to rapidly and accurately identify invasive plants based on morphology because they are an assemblage of many different families and many plant materials lack sufficient diagnostic characteristics during border inspections. It is therefore urgent to evaluate candidate loci and build a reliable genetic library to prevent invasive plants from entering China. In this study, five common single markers (ITS, ITS2, matK, rbcL and trnH-psbA) were evaluated using 634 species (including 469 invasive plant species in China, 10 new records to China, 16 potentially invasive plant species around the world but not introduced into China yet and 139 plant species native to China) based on three different methods. Our results indicated that ITS2 displayed largest intra- and interspecific divergence (1.72\% and 91.46\%). Based on NJ tree method, ITS2, ITS, matK, rbcL and trnH-psbA provided 76.84\%, 76.5\%, 63.21\%, 52.86\% and 50.68\% discrimination rates, respectively. The combination of ITS + matK performed best and provided 91.03\% discriminatory power, followed by ITS2 + matK (85.78\%). For identifying unknown individuals, ITS + matK had 100\% correct identification rate based on our database, followed by ITS/ITS2 (both 93.33\%) and ITS2 + matK (91.67\%). Thus, we propose ITS/ ITS2 + matK as the most suitable barcode for invasive plants in China. This study also demonstrated that DNA barcoding is an efficient tool for identifying invasive species.},

  abstract = {Background: Preparation of large quantity and high quality genomic DNA from a large number of plant samples is a major bottleneck for most genetic and genomic analyses, such as, genetic mapping, TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesion IN Genome), and next-generation sequencing directly from sheared genomic DNA. A variety of DNA preparation methods and commercial kits are available. However, they are either low throughput, low yield, or costly. Here, we describe a method for high throughput genomic DNA isolation from sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] leaves and dry seeds with high yield, high quality, and affordable cost.
Results: We developed a high throughput DNA isolation method by combining a high yield CTAB extraction method with an improved cleanup procedure based on MagAttract kit. The method yielded large quantity and high quality DNA from both lyophilized sorghum leaves and dry seeds. The DNA yield was improved by nearly 30 fold with 4 times less consumption of MagAttract beads. The method can also be used in other plant species, including cotton leaves and pine needles.
Conclusion: A high throughput system for DNA extraction from sorghum leaves and seeds was developed and validated. The main advantages of the method are low cost, high yield, high quality, and high throughput. One person can process two 96-well plates in a working day at a cost of \$0.10 per sample of magnetic beads plus other consumables that other methods will also need.},

  abstract = {The recent introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies represents a major revolution in providing new tools for identifying the genes and/or genomic intervals controlling important traits for selection in breeding programs. In perennial fruit trees with long generation times and large sizes of adult plants, the impact of these techniques is even more important. High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have provided complete annotated sequences in many important tree species. Most of the highthroughput genotyping platforms described are being used for studies of genetic diversity and population structure. Dissection of complex traits became possible through the availability of genome sequences along with phenotypic variation data, which allow to elucidate the causative genetic differences that give rise to observed phenotypic variation. Association mapping facilitates the association between genetic markers and phenotype in unstructured and complex populations, identifying molecular markers for assisted selection and breeding. Also, genomic data provide in silico identiﬁcation and characterization of genes and gene families related to important traits, enabling new tools for molecular marker assisted selection in tree breeding. Deep sequencing of transcriptomes is also a powerful tool for the analysis of precise expression levels of each gene in a sample. It consists in quantifying short cDNA reads, obtained by NGS technologies, in order to compare the entire transcriptomes between genotypes and environmental conditions. The miRNAs are non-coding short RNAs involved in the regulation of different physiological processes, which can be identiﬁed by highthroughput sequencing of RNA libraries obtained by reverse transcription of puriﬁed short RNAs, and by in silico comparison with known miRNAs from other species. All together, NGS techniques and their applications have increased the resources for plant breeding in tree species, closing the former gap of genetic tools between trees and annual species.},

In this review, we draw on published literature that incorporates sampling theory and spatial statistics in population genetic analyses to identify key factors to consider when designing a sampling strategy. We discuss how sampling design is affected by research objectives, biology of the study species, population structure, marker choice, and the genetic parameters to be investigated, and we offer suggestions on defining sampling units and developing sampling protocols.},

We use simulated data to evaluate how highly polymorphic molecular markers affect precision and bias in the single-sample method based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). Results of this study are as follows: (1) Low-frequency alleles upwardly bias N\^e, but a simple rule can reduce bias to $<$about 10\% without sacriﬁcing much precision. (2) With datasets routinely available today (10–20 loci with 10 alleles; 50 individuals), precise estimates can be obtained for relatively small populations (Ne $<$ 200), and small populations are not likely to be mistaken for large ones. However, it is very difﬁcult to obtain reliable estimates for large populations. (3) With ‘microsatellite’ data, the LD method has greater precision than the temporal method, unless the latter is based on samples taken many generations apart. Our results indicate the LD method has widespread applicability to conservation (which typically focuses on small populations) and the study of evolutionary processes in local populations. Considerable opportunity exists to extract more information about Ne in nature by wider use of single-sample estimators and by combining estimates from different methods.},

  abstract = {Analysis of linkage disequilibrium (r\^2=mean squared correlation of allele frequencies at diﬀerent gene loci) provides a means of estimating eﬀective population size (Ne) from a single sample, but this method has seen much less use than the temporal method (which requires at least two samples). It is shown that for realistic numbers of loci and alleles, the linkage disequilibrium method can provide precision comparable to that of the temporal method. However, computer simulations show that estimates of Ne based on r\^2 for unlinked, diallelic gene loci are sharply biased downwards (N\^e=N$<$0:1 in some cases) if sample size (S) is less than true Ne. The bias is shown to arise from inaccuracies in published formula for Eðr\^2Þ when S and/or Ne are small. Empirically derived modiﬁcations to Eð\^r2Þ for two mating systems (random mating and lifetime monogamy) eﬀectively eliminate the bias (residual bias in N\^e$<$5\% in most cases). The modiﬁed method also performs well in estimating Ne in non-ideal populations with skewed sex ratio or non-random variance in reproductive success. Recent population declines are not likely to seriously aﬀect N\^e, but if N has recently increased from a bottleneck N\^e can be biased downwards for a few generations. These results should facilitate application of the disequilibrium method for estimating contemporary Ne in natural populations. However, a comprehensive assessment of performance of r\^2 with highly polymorphic markers such as microsatellites is needed.},

  abstract = {In molecular ecology and conservation genetics studies, the important parameter of effective population size (Ne) is increasingly estimated from a single sample of individuals taken at random from a population and genotyped at a number of marker loci. Several estimators are developed, based on the information of linkage disequilibrium (LD), heterozygote excess (HE), molecular coancestry (MC), and sibship frequency (SF) in marker data. The most popular is the LD estimator, because it is more accurate than HE and MC estimators, and is simpler to calculate than SF estimator. However, little is known about the accuracy of LD estimator relative to that of SF, and about the robustness of all single-sample estimators when some simplifying assumptions (e.g. random mating, no linkage, no genotyping errors) are violated. This study fills the gaps, and uses extensive simulations to compare the biases and accuracies of the 4 estimators for different population properties (e.g. bottlenecks, nonrandom mating, haplodiploid), marker properties (e.g. linkage, polymorphisms) and sample properties (e.g. numbers of individuals and markers), and to compare the robustness of the 4 estimators when marker data are imperfect (with allelic dropouts). Extensive simulations show that SF estimator is more accurate, has a much wider application scope (e.g. suitable to non-random mating such as selfing, haplodiploid species, dominant markers) and is more robust (e.g. to the presence of linkage and genotyping errors of markers) than the other estimators. An empirical dataset from a Yellowstone grizzly bear population was analysed to demonstrate the use of the SF estimator in practice.},

Chemical and genetic wood characteristics are potentially suitable tools, but their performance at small spatial scales is unknown. Here we test whether stable isotopes and microsatellites can diﬀerentiate Tali timber (Erythrophleum spp.) at the level of forest concessions. We collected 394 wood samples from 134 individuals in ﬁve concessions in Cameroon and Congo Republic. The nearest neighbour concessions were 14 km apart and the furthest pair 836 km apart. We constructed genetic proﬁles using eight nuclear microsatellite markers and measured concentrations of δ18O, δ15N and δ13C. We diﬀerentiated provenances using PCA (microsatellites), ANOVA and kernel discriminant analysis (isotopes). Next, we performed assignment tests using blind samples (n = 12, microsatellites) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV, isotopes). Isotopic composition varied strongly within concessions and only δ13C diﬀered signiﬁcantly between two concessions. As a result, LOOCV performed only marginally better than random. Genetic diﬀerentiation among provenances was also relatively low, but private alleles were commonly found. Bayesian clustering analysis correctly assigned 92\% of the blind samples, including those of nearby concessions. Thus, Tali timber can be successfully assigned to the concession of origin using genetic markers, but not using isotopic composition. Isotopic diﬀerentiation may be possible at larger spatial scales or with stronger climatic or topographic variation. Our study shows that genetic analyses can diﬀerentiate the geographic origin of tropical timber at the scale of forest concessions, demonstrating their potential as forensic tools to enforce timber trade legislation.},

The bark, which contains a variable proportion of less valuable secondary bast fibre, is more valuable as a raw material for paper than the core. A study of the factors affecting the quality of hemp grown in The Netherlands for paper production is described. The bark content in the stem was determined by mechanically separating bark and core. The chemical composition of bark and core was determined according to procedures defined by the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry. The secondary bast fibre content was determined by manually separating primary and secondary phloem tissue after boiling in a 2\% NaOH solution. Bark content in the stem decreased during the growing season; at harvest in September it ranged from 30 to 35\% depending on cultivar and plant density. The proportion of secondary bast fibre in the bast fibre fraction increased with stem weight, from 10 to 45\%. Measurement of secondary bast fibre in a representative stem section allowed the proportion of this fibre in the bast fibre fraction of the entire stem to be estimated accurately. Differences in chemical composition within sets of samples of bark or core were small compared with the difference between bark and core. The bark of the French cultivars tested contained less cellulose than that of the Hungarian cultivars. Bark quality for paper making improved during the growing season because the cellulose content in the bark increased, whereas the content of lignin and extractives decreased.},

We investigated the performance of one-year-old seedlings of native resprouters, that is, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus ilex, and Rhamnus alaternus, in a combination of vegetation clearing and mulching with brush chipping in three sites with high amount of fuel load. The planting holes inside the shrublands showed lower radiation and soil surface temperature than those in the cleared areas, whereas soil water content was higher in the mulched holes than in the unmulched ones, especially when water availability was lowest. Seedling survival of Q. ilex and R. alaternus signiﬁcantly increased within the shrubland; P. lentiscus showed the opposite effect, but its survival was enhanced by the mulching treatment. The three species grew faster in the cleared plots although, unexpectedly, mulching showed a negative effect on Q. ilex relative growth rate in diameter. Our results suggest that the combination of fuel control and reforestation as techniques for shrubland management is an appropriate option, at least in the short term, to redirect vegetation dynamics toward later successional stages, improving ecosystem resilience by the introduction of woody resprouter species.},

The ‘‘6class’’ rating system was used to quantify the degree of tree infection. The most intensive mistletoe infection was observed on old age trees. Extensive tree mortality was observed during the years 2000–2002. Low precipitation in two consecutive years (2000–2001) was an important parameter that affected tree mortality. Fir trees were attacked by the bark beetles Phaenops knoteki (Buprestidae) and Pityokteines spinidens (Scolytidae). Mistletoe is an important factor that reduces tree vigour and predisposes trees to beetle attacks during periods of low precipitation. Tree mortality was correlated with the degree of mistletoe infection. During a 5-year-period (1998–2002), mortality of trees with heavy and medium mistletoe infection was 44.44\%, while mortality of trees with light infection was 9.5\% and that of the non-infected trees 4.66\%.},

Leaf samples from nineteen Abies alba individuals from Ogorijevac site were collected, where nine of them were determined by morphological traits as Abies alba f. ´Pyramidalis´ and ten as a typical, silver fir, (Abies alba Mill.). PCR amplification was done with the 19 SSR primers in three multiplex mixes (16 EST-SSRs divided in 2 multiplexes and three genomic SSRs as a separate multiplex mix). Successful amplification was obtained for 17 out of 19 markers. Fragment analysis of PCR products was done on capillary electrophoresis automatic sequencer where, afterwards, scoring of resulted peaks was obtained using the GeneMarker V2.4.0 and MicroChecker software. Spatial genetic profile analysis was evaluated via BAPS software. The results of spatial BAPS showed the presence of two clusters (7/12) among 19 sampled individuals, indicating significant difference in genetic profile between selected silver fir (taxa) samples. Cluster differentiation within marginalised population of silver fir showed the results of such genetic profile which will be used as a platform for further molecular genetic research and conservation strategies of this endemic species. This research was done on STSM project within COST Action FP 1202 (MaP-FGR).},

To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to analyse the temporal component of SGS by following the dynamics of successive cohorts of the same population over time, rather than analysing different age cohorts at a single time. SGS is influenced by various factors including restricted gene dispersal, microenvironmental selection, mating patterns and the spatial pattern of reproductive individuals. Several factors that affect SGS are expected to vary over time and as adult density increases. Using air photo analysis, tree-ring dating and molecular marker analysis we reconstructed the spread of reproductive individuals over 30 years beginning from five initial individuals. In the early stages, genotypes were distributed randomly in space. Over time and with increasing density, fine-scale ($<$ 20 m) SGS developed and the magnitude of genetic clustering increased. The SGS was strongly affected by the initial spatial distribution and genetic variation of the founding individuals. The development of SGS may be explained by fine-scale environmental heterogeneity and possibly microenvironmental selection. Inbreeding and variation in reproductive success may have enhanced SGS magnitude over time.},

  abstract = {The consequences of reforestation practices on the genetic variation and structure of forest tree populations are reviewed assessed and discussed, with a focus on the selection and handling of forest reproductive material (FRM). It emerges that averaging genetic diversity parameters, such as those typically reported in the assessment of forest population genetics, generally present some reduction when comparing populations established through reforestation and natural geographically proximal “control” populations. Even when differences are not substantial, subtler changes that regard the structure of genetic variation and the lasting adaptive potential of natural forest tree populations, are detected. Therefore, reforestation practices may have a longer-term impact on the genetic diversity and structure of forest tree populations, and their assessment should be based on parameters that are sensitive to population perturbations and bottlenecks. In this respect, reforestation exerts a significant influence on the resilience of forest ecosystems, defined as their capacity to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change in order to retain essentially the same function (processes and properties), and ecosystem services. Neutral and adaptive genetic diversity provides a mechanism reinforcing both population perseverance and persistence of ecosystem functions and loss of genetic diversity may reduce resilience. To the level that genetic diversity affects species resilience, the genetic changes found as a result of reforestation practices may eventually decrease fitness and exert some unfavourable influence on the resilience of forest ecosystems. The nature and extent of genetic effects and impact of reforestation, call for a concerted effort regarding their thorough study using genetic, genomic, as well as monitoring approaches, in order to provide insight and improve future practices.},

  abstract = {The lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia are dominated by a single family of canopy and emergent trees, the Dipterocarpaceae. The seeds of dipterocarps are gravity or gyration dispersed. Short distance and limited seed dispersal via these mechanisms result in the aggregation of related individuals and strong ﬁne-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS). In logged and fragmented forests, where gene ﬂow may be disrupted, tree species with strong FSGS are predicted to exhibit increased inbreeding, which consequently can erode genetic diversity, ﬁtness and might limit the potential for natural regeneration of dipterocarps. Developing a set of indirect operational indicators for FSGS provides a solid basis for informing conservation and management of forest genetic resources in logged forests. Our main objective was to use an information theoretic approach to identify these indicators of FSGS in dipterocarps. We quantify FSGS in 19 dipterocarp species across four forest sites in Malaysian Borneo, India and the Seychelles. We detected FSGS in 15 (79\%) of our study species, most of which displayed signiﬁcant inbreeding. Our results suggest that wood density and ﬂower size offer useful indicators of FSGS. We propose some simple guidelines to allow forest managers to account for FSGS when planning approaches to maintain genetically diverse stands in logged dipterocarp forests. The integration of improved understanding of genetic processes is essential for conserving forest tree genetic resources and ensuring the resilience of logged forests.},

Given this argument, we ask: how do we cultivate the potential for virtuous cycles to confer resilience in social–ecological systems? To answer this question, we review feedback mechanisms and identify virtuous cycles catalyzed via ecological restoration to highlight their importance to the resilience of social–ecological systems. We then conceptualize these cycles with a causal map (also known as a causal loop diagram) illustrating an example where restoration activities and civic ecology practices contributed to feedbacks and virtuous cycles. Following from this example, we discuss approaches for recognizing and investing in virtuous cycles that accompany social–ecological systems and outline approaches for managing such cycles.},

  abstract = {In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P $<$ 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P $<$ 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a ‘disturbance paradox’, documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5\% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6\%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.},

In the past the efﬁciencies of these distance measures in constructing phylogenetic trees have been studied mathematically or by computer simulations. Recently, however, allele frequencies of 783 STR loci have been compiled from various human populations. We have therefore used these empirical data to investigate the relative efﬁciencies of different distance measures in constructing phylogenetic trees. The results showed that (1) the probability of obtaining the correct branching pattern of a tree (PC) is generally highest for DA distance; (2) FS*T, standard genetic distance (DS), and FST=ð1 À FSTÞ give similar PC-values, FS*T being slightly better than the other two; and (3) (dm)2 shows PC-values much lower than the other distance measures.

Efforts to develop new and to adapt existing genomic resources to lessstudied members of this genus should not only improve oak conservation and management but also aid the study of fundamental evolutionary processes. Here, we present a suite of 27 highly polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers tested in four North American red oak (Quercus section Lobatae) species: Q. rubra, Q. ellipsoidalis, Q. coccinea, and Q. velutina. Five markers are genomic SSRs (gSSRs) — four novel and one previously transferred from Q. petraea — and 22 are gene-based SSRs derived from Q. robur and Q. petraea expressed sequence tags (EST-SSRs). Overall, levels of polymorphism detected with these primer pairs were high, with gene diversity (He) averaging 0.66 across all loci in natural populations. In addition, we show that EST-SSR markers may have the potential to detect divergent selection at stress-resistance candidate genes among closely related oak species.},

For six species, the genome content was further analyzed by flow cytometry in order to determine the nuclear genome size. Sequencing yielded a depth of 0.8X to 7.5X, from which in silico analysis yielded preliminary estimates of gene and repetitive sequence content in the genome for each species. Thousands of genomic SSRs were identified, with a clear predisposition toward dinucleotide repeats and AT-rich repeat motifs. Flanking primers were designed for SSR loci for all ten species, ranging from 891 loci in sugar maple to 18,167 in redbay. In summary, we have demonstrated that useful preliminary genome information including repeat content, gene content and useful SSR markers can be obtained at low cost and time input from a single lane of Illumina multiplex sequence.},

  abstract = {METHODS: Using DNA from 45 individuals from 13 localities across the species’ range, we sequenced portions of 40 candidate genes related to budburst/ flowering, growth, osmotic stress, and temperature stress. Using 195 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we estimated genetic differentiation across populations and correlated allele frequencies with climate gradients using single-locus and multivariate models.
RESULTS: The top 5\% of FST estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.68, yielding loci potentially under spatially divergent selection. Environmental analyses of SNP frequencies with climate gradients revealed three significantly correlated SNPs within budburst/flowering genes and two SNPs within temperature stress genes with mean annual precipitation, after controlling for multiple testing. A redundancy model showed a significant association between SNPs and climate variables and revealed a similar set of SNPs with high loadings on the first axis. In the RDA, climate accounted for 67\% of the explained variation, when holding climate constant, in contrast to a putatively neutral SSR data set where climate accounted for only 33\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Population differentiation and geographic gradients of allele frequencies in climate-associated functional genes in Q. lobata provide initial evidence of adaptive genetic variation and background for predicting population response to climate change.},

  abstract = {Data from multilocus enzyme electrophoresis of bacterial populations were analyzed using a statistical test designed to detect associations between genes at different loci. Some species (e.g., SalmoneUa) were found to be clonal at all levels of analysis. At the other extreme, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is panmictic, with random association between loci. Two intermediate types of population structure were also found. Neisseria meningitidis displays what we have called an "epidemic" structure. There is significant association between loci, but this arises only because of the recent, explosive, increase in particular electrophoretic types; when this effect is eliminated the population is found to be effectively panmictic. In contrast, linkage disequilibrium in a population of Rhizobium meliloti exists because the sample consisted of two genetically isolated divisions, often fixed for different alleles: within each division association between loci was almost random. The method of analysis is appropriate whenever there is doubt about the extent of genetic recombination between members of a population. To illustrate this we analyzed data on protozoan parasites and again found panmictic, epidemic, and clonal population structures.},

These methods are intended to be complementary to current morphological and chemical methods of identification. The adoption of these methods by industry will be accelerated by the introduction of DNA-based identification techniques into regulatory standards and monographs. The introduction of DNA methods into the British Pharmacopoeia is described, along with a reference standard for use as a positive control for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A general troubleshooting chart is provided to guide the user through the problems that may be encountered during this process. Nevertheless, the nature of the plant materials and the demands of industrial quality control procedures mean that conventional DNA barcoding is not the method of choice for industrial quality control. The design of DNA barcode-targeted quantitative PCR and high resolution melt curve tests is one strategy for developing rapid, robust, and reliable protocols for high-throughput screening of raw materials. The development of authentication tests for wild-harvested Rhodiola rosea L. is used as a case study to exemplify these relatively simple tests. By way of contrast, the application of next-generation sequencing to create a complete profile of all the biological entities in a mixed herbal drug is described and its potential for industrial quality assurance discussed.},

  abstract = {Variation of DNA methylation is thought to play an important role for rapid adjustments of plant populations to dynamic environmental conditions, thus compensating for the relatively slow response time of genetic adaptations. However, genetic and epigenetic variation of wild plant populations has not yet been directly compared in fast changing environments. Here, we surveyed populations of Viola elatior from two adjacent habitat types along a successional gradient characterized by strong differences in light availability. Using ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive ampliﬁcation polymorphisms (MSAP) analyses, we found relatively low levels of genetic (H0gen = 0.19) and epigenetic (H0epi = 0.23) diversity and high genetic (/ST = 0.72) and epigenetic (/ST = 0.51) population differentiation. Diversity and differentiation were signiﬁcantly correlated, suggesting that epigenetic variation partly depends on the same driving forces as genetic variation. Correlation-based genome scans detected comparable levels of genetic (17.0\%) and epigenetic (14.2\%) outlier markers associated with site speciﬁc light availability. However, as revealed by separate differentiation-based genome scans for AFLP, only few genetic markers seemed to be actually under positive selection (0–4.5\%). Moreover, principal coordinates analyses and Mantel tests showed that overall epigenetic variation was more closely related to habitat conditions, indicating that environmentally induced methylation changes may lead to convergence of populations experiencing similar habitat conditions and thus may play a major role for the transient and/or heritable adjustment to changing environments. Additionally, using a new MSAP-scoring approach, we found that mainly the unmethylated (/ST = 0.60) and CG-methylated states (/ST = 0.46) of epiloci contributed to population differentiation and putative habitat-related adaptation, whereas CHG-hemimethylated states (/ST = 0.21) only played a marginal role.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an important, heritable epigenetic modiﬁcation in most eukaryotic organisms that is connected with numerous biological processes. To study the impact of natural epigenetic variation in an ecological or evolutionary context, epigenetic studies are increasingly using methylation-sensitive ampliﬁcation polymorphism (MSAP) for surveys at the population or species level. However, no consensus exists on how to interpret and score the multistate information obtained from the MSAP banding patterns. Here, we review the previously used scoring approaches for population epigenetic studies and develop new alternatives. To assess effects of the different approaches on parameters of epigenetic diversity and differentiation, we applied eight scoring schemes to a case study of three populations of the plant species Viola elatior. For a total number of 168 detected polymorphic MSAP fragments, the number of ultimately scored polymorphic epiloci ranged between 78 and 286 depending on the particular scoring scheme. Both, estimates of epigenetic diversity and differentiation varied strongly between scoring approaches. However, linear regression and PCoA revealed qualitatively similar patterns, suggesting that the scoring approaches are largely consistent. For single-locus analyses of MSAP data, for example the search for loci under selection, we advocate a new scoring approach that separately takes into account different methylation types and thus seems appropriate for drawing more detailed conclusions in ecological or evolutionary contexts. An R script (MSAP\_score.r) for scoring and basic data analysis is provided.},

The effects on recycling behavior of both personal variables (personality, demographics, and attitudes of environmental concern) and manipulable situational variables are reviewed. Results indicate that high income is a good predictor of recycling, whereas gender and age are not. General environmental concern appears to be related to recycling only when recycling requires a high degree of effort. However, relevant specific attitudes have consistently been found to correlate with recycling behavior. The seven situational variables reviewed (prompts, public commitment, normative influence, goal setting, removing barriers, providing rewards, and feedback) all produce significant increases in recycling behavior. However, there are several major limitations to the research. Results are based largely on single-variable assessments of recycling, and fail to consider interactions with characteristics of the environment or the population involved.},

Contrastingly, the southern population (Guara) shows climatic variables close to western sites but without defoliation and with a higher genetic diversity, indicating a possible adaptation to the sub-Mediterranean conditions.

However, the large number of alleles imply that large sample sizes are required for accurate reflection of genotypic frequencies. Estimates of genetic distance are often biased at small sample sizes, and biases and sampling variances can be affected by the number of, and distances between, alleles. Using data from a large collection of larval cod (Gadus morhua) from a single area, I examined the effect of sample size on seven genetic distance and two structure metrics. Pairs of samples (equal or unequal) of various sizes were drawn at random from a pool of 856 individuals scored for six microsatellite loci. (δµ)2, DSW, RST, and FST were the best performers in terms of bias and variance. Sample sizes of 50 ≤ N ≤ 100 individuals were generally necessary for precise estimation of genetic distances and this value depended on number of loci, number of alleles, and range in allele size.

We offer 6 lessons from our experiences applying new approaches and tools for quantifying BES in 20 pilot demonstrations: (1) Applying a BES approach is most effective in leading to policy change as part of an iterative science-policy process; (2) simple ecological production function models have been useful in a diverse set of decision contexts, across a broad range of biophysical, social, and governance systems. Key limitations of simple models arise at very small scales, and in predicting speciﬁc future BES values; (3) training local experts in the approaches and tools is important for building local capacity, ownership, trust, and long-term success; (4) decision makers and stakeholders prefer to use a variety of BES value metrics, not only monetary values; (5) an important science gap exists in linking changes in BES to changes in livelihoods, health, cultural values, and other metrics of human wellbeing; and (6) communicating uncertainty in useful and transparent ways remains challenging.},

  abstract = {Rapid genetic changes in plants have been reported in response to current climate change. We assessed the capacity of trees in a natural forest to produce rapid acclimation responses based on epigenetic modiﬁcations. We analysed natural populations of Quercus ilex, the dominant tree species of Mediterranean forests, using the methylation-sensitive ampliﬁed polymorphism (MSAP) technique to assess patterns and levels of methylation in individuals from unstressed forest plots and from plots experimentally exposed to drought for 12 years at levels projected for the coming decades. The percentage of hypermethylated loci increased, and the percentage of fully methylated loci clearly decreased in plants exposed to drought. Multivariate analyses exploring the status of methylation at MSAP loci also showed clear differentiation depending on stress. The PCA scores for the MSAP proﬁles clearly separated the genetic from the epigenetic structure, and also signiﬁcantly separated the samples within each group in response to drought. Changes in DNA methylation highlight the large capacity of plants to rapidly acclimate to changing environmental conditions, including trees with long life spans, and our results demonstrate those changes. These changes, although unable to prevent the decreased growth and higher mortality associated with this experimental drought, occurred together with a dampening in such decreases as the long-term treatment progressed.},

A much larger portion, particularly for varieties occupying inland sites, should require either introduction of better suited species or conversion to better adapted genotypes. Regeneration strategies are considered with the goal of matching growth potential of contemporary populations to the future climate where that potential can be realized. For some lands, natural reproduction should be suitable, but most lands will require forest renewal to maintain forest health, growth, and productivity.

  abstract = {Genetic diversity is one of the three forms of biodiversity recognized by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as deserving conservation. The need to conserve genetic diversity within populations is based on two arguments: the necessity of genetic diversity for evolution to occur, and the expected relationship between heterozygosity and population fitness. Because loss of genetic diversity is related to inbreeding, and inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness, a correlation is expected between heterozygosity and population fitness. Long-term effective population size, which determines rates of inbreeding, should also be correlated with fitness. However, other theoretical considerations and empirical observations suggest that the correlation between fitness and heterozygosity may be weak or nonexistent. We used all the data sets we could locate (34) to perform a meta-analysis and resolve the issue. Data sets were included in the study, provided that fitness, or a component of fitness, was measured for three or more populations along with heterozygosity, heritability, and/or population size. The mean weighted correlation between measures of genetic diversity, at the population level, and population fitness was 0.4323. The correlation was highly significant and explained 19\% of the variation in fitness. Our study strengthens concerns that the loss of heterozygosity has a deleterious effect on population fitness and supports the IUCN designation of genetic diversity as worthy of conservation.},

  volume = {78},
  abstract = {Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) has become increasingly rare across large portions of its range in eastern North America as a result of a general and widespread decline over the past century. Genetic diversity, population genetic structure, outcrossing rates in the filled seeds, and actual inbreeding levels were characterized in five small, isolated, remnant red spruce populations from the disjunct northwestern limits of its range in Ontario and five populations from the larger, more extensive Maritime populations of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to determine genetic and reproductive status, to provide some benchmarks for monitoring genetic changes resulting from isolation and restricted population sizes, and to assist the development of restoration and conservation strategies. Thirty-seven allozyme loci coding for 15 enzymes were used for genetic diversity assessments, and six of the most polymorphic loci were used for mating system determination. On average, 29.1\% (95\% criterion) of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was 1.60, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.097 and 0.100, respectively. The Ontario populations were comparable to or slightly less genetically variable than those from the Maritimes. Only 4.7\% of the detected genetic variation was among stands; the remainder was among individuals within stands. The Maritime populations were genetically less differentiated from each other than those in Ontario. With the exception of three Maritime populations clustering tightly in one group, there was no clear separation of Ontario red spruce populations from Maritime red spruce populations based on genetic distance as well as canonical discriminant analyses. The average multilocus (tm) and single-locus (ts) population outcrossing rates were 0.595 and 0.558, respectively, indicating a comparatively high tolerance for inbreeding up to the filled seed stage of development in red spruce. The Ontario populations, on average, showed higher outcrossing rates (tm = 0.654, ts = 0.641) than the Maritime populations (tm = 0.535, ts = 0.475). Individual family outcrossing rates were similar to their respective population outcrossing rates and no significant differences were observed among families within populations for the multilocus estimates. When such high levels of inbreeding in filled seeds were combined with the proportions of empty (post-pollination-aborted) seeds, it appears that actual inbreeding levels may vary from 48 to 86\%. The highest inbreeding levels occurred in the smallest, most isolated Ontario populations and in those populations most likely to have been affected by poorer pollination conditions. Allozyme variation indicates that in the short term, extant remnants of Ontario red spruce have maintained their genetic diversity and integrity. For artificial restoration of red spruce in Ontario, local seed sources could be used without undue concern over losses of genetic diversity. However, over the longer term, genetic drift and inbreeding may be expected to result in further losses of genetic diversity and (or) reproductive fitness if population sizes, numbers, and distribution continue to decline.},

  abstract = {Increased use of forest resources and a shrinking forestland base threaten the sustainability of forest genetic resources and highlight the importance of conservation and sustainable management of these resources. As forest trees are normally the keystone species of forest ecosystems, their continued existence is essential for many ﬂoral and faunal associations of these ecosystems. Major concepts, challenges and opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources are brieﬂy discussed in this paper. The major challenges include population decline and population structure changes due to forest removal and conversion of forest land to other uses, forest fragmentation, forestry practices, climate change, disease conditions, introduced pests, atmospheric pollution, and introgressive hybridization. Developing scientiﬁcally sound conservation strategies, maintaining minimum viable population sizes, and deployment of genetically engineered organisms represent other important challenges in conservation. The usefulness of various biochemical and molecular genetic markers, adaptive traits, and genetic diversity measures for developing conservation strategies for in situ and ex situ genetic resource conservation are also discussed. Major opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources include: use of molecular genetic markers and adaptive traits for developing conservation strategies; in situ conservation through natural reserves, protected areas, and sustainable forest management practices; ex situ conservation through germplasm banks, common garden archives, seed banks, DNA banks, and tissue culture and cryopreservation; incorporation of disease, pest, and stress tolerance traits through genetic transformation; plantation forestry; and ecological restoration of rare or declining tree species and populations. Forest genetic resource conservation and resource use should be considered complementary rather than contradictory to each other.},

  abstract = {The dramatic decline of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) populations in Newfoundland over the past 100 years presents an opportunity to determine and monitor population bottleneck effects on genetic diversity in trees. To provide benchmarks and indicators for monitoring genetic changes due to recent and future bottleneck events and to assist development of conservation strategies, we assessed genetic diversity and structure of six small, isolated white pine populations from two regions at the limits of its geographical range in Newfoundland for comparison with three populations from its central range in Ontario for 20 allozyme loci coding for 12 enzymes. On average, 47.8\% of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was 1.75, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.215 and 0.195, respectively. Although most of the alleles were widespread, unique alleles were found in three of the nine populations examined. The Newfoundland populations were as genetically variable as those from Ontario. Generally, all populations exhibited slight excess of heterozygotes at most loci. Only 6.1\% of the detected genetic variation was among populations, and the remainder among individuals within populations. The genetic distances among the populations within a province or region were as great as those among populations between the provinces or regions. Canonical discriminant functions and cluster analysis from genetic distances separated nine populations into the same four groups. Neither provincial nor regional or geographic gradient-related patterns of population variation and differentiation were apparent. It appears that 8000 years of postglacial geographic isolation and recent population decline have had little or no detectable effect on genetic diversity or differentiation of disjunct Newfoundland white pine populations from their ancestral mainland populations. Assuming their adaptability, the Ontario seed sources may be acceptable for white pine restoration in Newfoundland.},

Plant and insect sources were identiﬁed in ﬁve samples, but only the botanical or insect source could be identiﬁed in the other two. Two samples were found to be misrepresented. Although this method was generally successful in determining both plant and insect sources, honeys rich in polyphenolic compounds or subject to crystallization were recalcitrant to analysis, so further research is required to combat honey adulteration and mislabeling.},

Agr. 35(1):1-10. Native ﬁsh populations are decreasing due to several impact factors of the environment. In order to address this problem, several actions, for example stocking, have been accomplished. However, if these actions are undertaken without any scientiﬁc support, their efﬁciency is low, and they can cause loss of genetic diversity in the populations, and irreversible impacts in the next generations. For this reason, the use of molecular markers to assess diversity through genetic monitoring, can contribute to the conservation of the icthyofauna.},

  abstract = {Common walnut (Juglans regia L) is an economically important species cultivated worldwide for its high-quality wood and nuts. It is generally accepted that after the last glaciation J. regia survived and grew in almost completely isolated stands in Asia, and that ancient humans dispersed walnuts across Asia and into new habitats via trade and cultural expansion. The history of walnut in Europe is a matter of debate, however. In this study, we estimated the genetic diversity and structure of 91 Eurasian walnut populations using 14 neutral microsatellites. By integrating fossil pollen, cultural, and historical data with population genetics, and approximate Bayesian analysis, we reconstructed the demographic history of walnut and its routes of dispersal across Europe. The genetic data confirmed the presence of walnut in glacial refugia in the Balkans and western Europe. We conclude that humanmediated admixture between Anatolian and Balkan walnut germplasm started in the Early Bronze Age, and between western Europe and the Balkans in eastern Europe during the Roman Empire. A population size expansion and subsequent decline in northeastern and western Europe was detected in the last five centuries. The actual distribution of walnut in Europe resulted from the combined effects of expansion/contraction from multiple refugia after the Last Glacial Maximum and its human exploitation over the last 5,000 years.},

  abstract = {Plants offer excellent models to investigate how gene flow shapes the organization of genetic diversity. Their three genomes can have different modes of transmission and will hence experience varying levels of gene flow. We have compiled studies of genetic structure based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers in seed plants. Based on a data set of 183 species belonging to 103 genera and 52 families, we show that the precision of estimates of genetic differentiation (GST) used to infer gene flow is mostly constrained by the sampling of populations. Mode of inheritance appears to have a major effect on GST. Maternally inherited genomes experience considerably more subdivision (median value of 0.67) than paternally or biparentally inherited genomes (∼0.10). GST at cpDNA and mtDNA markers covary narrowly when both genomes are maternally inherited, whereas GST at paternally and biparentally inherited markers also covary positively but more loosely and GST at maternally inherited markers are largely independent of values based on nuclear markers. A model-based gross estimate suggests that, at the rangewide scale, historical levels of pollen flow are generally at least an order of magnitude larger than levels of seed flow (median of the pollen-to-seed migration ratio: 17) and that pollen and seed gene flow vary independently across species. Finally, we show that measures of subdivision that take into account the degree of similarity between haplotypes (NST or RST) make better use of the information inherent in haplotype data than standard measures based on allele frequencies only.},

After comparing the restriction fragments, the program determines if each fragment is susceptible to methylation (representative of epigenetic variation) or if there is no evidence of methylation (representative of genetic variation). The package provides, in a user-friendly command line interface, a pipeline of different analyses of the variation (genetic and epigenetic) among user-deﬁned groups of samples, as well as the classiﬁcation of the methylation occurrences in those groups. Statistical testing provides support to the analyses.

As a multipurpose tree, chestnut is used to produce timber, nuts, tannins, and other related products. Interspecific hybridization was first done in 1894 in the USA, in the 1910s in Japan, and in the 1920s in Europe. In the USA, blight resistant Chinese (C. mollissima) and Japanese (C. crenata) species have been used since 1930 as the pollen parents in a backcrossing program with American chestnuts (C. dentata) as the recurrent parent, in order to produced blight resistant timber chestnuts. In Europe, Japanese chestnut trees were introduced because of their resistance to ink disease (caused by Phytophthora spp.). A clonal collection of hybrids of Japanese chestnut crossed with European chestnut (C. sativa) is used to produce nuts and timber, and for rootstocks for local cultivars. The pellicle of the Japanese chestnut cultivars is not easily removed, but this has been overcome with the newly released Japanese chestnut hybrid ‘Porotan’, with the easy-peel pellicle trait controlled by a single recessive gene (P/p) from native Japanese chestnuts. After more than 100 years of chestnut hybridisation, new technologies and the recently reported genome sequence will allow us to face new threats and to maintain the rich genetic and cultural heritage of chestnut.},

The results showed that the chloroplast genome is highly variable in most of the investigated taxa and contains multiple variable regions that appear to be distributed throughout the whole genome. Species-diagnostic markers were found for four of the ten investigated species. Unexpectedly, intra-speci"c variation was also detected in four species.

  abstract = {Differences in needle traits of coniferous tree species are considered as the combined result of direct environmental pressure and specific genetic adaptations. In this study, diversity and differentiation within and among four Abies cephalonica subpopulations of a marginal population on Mt. Parnitha - Greece, were estimated using needle morphological traits and gene markers. We tested the connection of morphological variability patterns of light and shade needles with possible adaptation strategies and genetic diversity. Six morphological characteristics were used for the description of both light and shade needles at 100 trees, describing needle size and shape, stomatal density and needle position on the twigs. Additionally, six RAPD and three ISSR markers were applied on DNA from the same trees. Light needles were significantly different than shade needles, in all traits measured, apparently following a different light harvesting strategy. All four subpopulations exhibited high genetic diversity and the differentiation among them was relatively low. Differences among populations in light needles seemed to depend on light exposure and aspect. In shade needles, the four subpopulations seemed to deviate stronger from each other and express a rather geographic pattern, similarly to the genetic markers. Two of the subpopulations studied were lost during a wildfire, two years after sampling. Although the subpopulations burnt were most diverse and most differentiated, we expect a large part of the total genetic diversity of the burnt trees to still exist in the surviving subpopulations, since gene flow must have been effective in keeping all subpopulations connected.},

We reply as follows: (i) An evaluation of the seasonal erosion index at the European scale is, to our knowledge, not achievable at present with the available data but would be a future goal. Synchronous publication of the seasonal erosion index is not mandatory, speciﬁcally because seasonal soil loss ratios are not available at this scale to date.

We review the properties of complex systems using four well-studied forest biomes (temperate, boreal, tropical and Mediterranean) as examples. The lens of complex systems science yields insights into facets of forest structure and dynamics that facilitate comparisons among ecosystems. These biomes share the main properties of complex systems but differ in specific ecological properties, disturbance regimes, and human uses. We show how this approach can help forest scientists and managers to conceptualize forests as integrated social-ecological systems and provide concrete examples of how to manage forests as complex adaptive systems.},

The variations in most life history traits are shaped both by individual genotypic and by environmental variation. Forest trees exhibit high levels of genetic diversity, large population sizes, and gene ﬂow, and they also show a high level of plasticity for life history traits. We developed a new Physio-Demo-Genetics model (denoted PDG) coupling (i) a physiological module simulating individual tree responses to the environment; (ii) a demographic module simulating tree survival, reproduction, and pollen and seed dispersal; and (iii) a quantitative genetics module controlling the heritability of key life history traits. We used this model to investigate the plastic and genetic components of the variations in the timing of budburst (TBB) along an elevational gradient of Fagus sylvatica (the European beech). We used a repeated 5 years climatic sequence to show that ﬁve generations of natural selection were sufﬁcient to develop nonmonotonic genetic differentiation in the TBB along the local climatic gradient but also that plastic variation among different elevations and years was higher than genetic variation. PDG complements theoretical models and provides testable predictions to understand the adaptive potential of tree populations.},

  abstract = {Reforestation schemes, which encompass environmental plantings and natural regeneration of vegetation on cleared land, are increasingly being established for the purposes of mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, these schemes are themselves at risk from climate change and associated changes in disturbance regimes. Simultaneously, there is increasing pressure on reforested areas to achieve multiple co-beneﬁts, e.g. maximizing carbon storage, ameliorating environmental degradation and promoting biodiversity objectives, all while not adversely aﬀecting community values, such as agricultural production. Here, we review the myriad of biophysical risks posed by climate change to reforested areas while documenting management actions and policies that can enhance both the resistance and resilience of reforested areas to such risks. While it is diﬃcult to buﬀer vegetation against the direct eﬀects of climate change, such as elevated temperature and changed precipitation patterns, it is possible to manage some of the indirect eﬀects, such as wildﬁre, drought and insect defoliation. Methods for reducing the vulnerability of reforested areas range from site-speciﬁc management actions, particularly around design and location, through to regional and national scale initiatives, such as vulnerability assessments and decision support tools. The complexity of objectives and risks posed to reforested areas means that it is vitally important to evaluate outcomes from across the current estate of reforested areas. However, there is currently no national protocol in place in Australia to track, monitor or evaluate the outcomes of reforestation. Thus, we recommend the establishment of a national framework for analyzing and supporting the growing range of reforestation activities.},

Previous studies have used DNA barcoding to inventory species for applications in biodiversity monitoring, conservation impact assessment, monitoring of illegal trading, authentication of traded medicinal plants etc. This is the first tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF) barcode study in the World and the first attempt to assemble a reference barcode library for the trees of India as part of a larger project initiated by this research group.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We sampled 429 trees representing 143 tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF) species, which included 16 threatened species. DNA barcoding was completed using rbcL and matK markers. The tiered approach (1st tier rbcL; 2nd tier matK) correctly identified 136 out of 143 species (95\%). This high level of species resolution was largely due to the fact that the tree species were taxonomically diverse in the TDEF. Ability to resolve taxonomically diverse tree species of TDEF was comparable among the best match method, the phylogenetic method, and the characteristic attribute organization system method.
Conclusions: We demonstrated the utility of the TDEF reference barcode library to authenticate wood samples from timber operations in the TDEF. This pilot research study will enable more comprehensive surveys of the illegal timber trade of threatened species in the TDEF. This TDEF reference barcode library also contains trees that have medicinal properties, which could be used to monitor unsustainable and indiscriminate collection of plants from the wild for their medicinal value.},

Differentiation and adaptation in C. bursa-pastoris are shortly reviewed. Based on this knowledge, two Botanical Gardens are currently arranging long-term sites characterised by annual ploughing for the genetic monitoring of C. bursa-pastoris. Demographic parameters will be monitored as well, i.e. different life-cycle phases such as ﬂowering, fruiting, and the soil seed bank. Furthermore, seeds of at least 20 individuals will be sampled per year. Isozyme analyses, ﬂow cytometry, AFLPs, SNPs as well as microsatellites will be utilised to characterise changes in genetic diversity patterns over time. In general, the objective of our genetic monitoring of C. bursa-pastoris is to address the following questions: In the light of future research, our objectives are to study whether the genetic structure and diversity of C. bursa-pastoris alter over time, whether a possible invasion of ecotypes/genotypes of Sheperd’s purse is traceable using genetic markers, and whether it is possible to relate variation in reproductive patterns to respective candidate genes, which may be useful for monitoring.},

  abstract = {Genetic analysis was carried out in order to provide insights into differentiation among populations of two interfertile oak species, Quercus petraea and Quercus robur. Gene ﬂow between the two species, local adaptation and speciation processes in general, may leave differential molecular signatures across the genome. Three interspeciﬁc pairs of natural populations from three ecologically different regions, one in central Europe (SW Germany) and two in the Balkan Peninsula (Greece and Bulgaria) were sampled. Grouping of highly informative SSR loci was made according to the component of variation they express—interspeciﬁc or provenance speciﬁc. ‘Species’ and ‘provenance discriminant’ loci were characterized based on FSTs. Locus speciﬁc FSTs were tested for deviation from the neutral expectation both within and between species. Data were then treated separately in a Bayesian analysis of genetic structure. By using three ‘species discriminant’ loci, high membership probability to inferred species groups was achieved. On the other hand, analysis of genetic structure based on ﬁve ‘provenance discriminant’ loci was correlated with geographic region and revealed shared genetic variation between neighbouring Q. petraea and Q. robur. Small sets of highly variable nuclear SSRs were sufﬁcient to discriminate, either between species or between provenances. Thus, an effective tool is provided for molecular identiﬁcation of both species and provenances. Furthermore, data suggest that a combination of gene ﬂow and natural selection forms these diversity patterns. ‘Species discriminant’ loci might represent genome regions affected by directional selection, which maintains species identity. ‘Provenance speciﬁc’ loci might represent genome regions with high interspeciﬁc gene ﬂow and common adaptive patterns to local environmental factors.},

Factors such as migration, level of population differentiation, and unequal sampling were varied in the data sets to mirror a range of realistic research scenarios. AMOVA performed well under all scenarios with a modest quantity of markers while STRUCTURE required a greater number, especially when populations were closely related. The popular DK method of determining the number of genetically distinct groups worked well when sampling was balanced, but underestimated the true number of groups with unbalanced sampling. These results provide a window through which to interpret previous work with dominant markers and we provide a protocol for determining the number of markers needed for future dominant marker studies.},

Resampling individuals is important when fewer than 25 individuals are sampled per population and when conﬁdence intervals are required for individual loci. Resampling loci provides conﬁdence intervals for sets of loci, such as a set presumed to be neutral, but can be anticonservative if fewer than 20 loci are analysed.

Research on long-lived woody perennials is extending our molecular knowledge of complex life histories and adaptations to the environment —enriching a field that has traditionally drawn biological inference from a few short-lived herbaceous species.},

  abstract = {Studies in conservation genetics often attempt to determine genetic diﬀerentiation between two or more temporally or geographically distinct sample collections. Pairwise p-values from Fisher’s exact tests or contingency Chi-square tests are commonly reported with a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. While the Bonferroni correction controls the experiment-wise a, this correction is very conservative and results in greatly diminished power to detect diﬀerentiation among pairs of sample collections. An alternative is to control the false discovery rate (FDR) that provides increased power, but this method only maintains experiment-wise a when none of the pairwise comparisons are signiﬁcant. Recent modiﬁcations to the FDR method provide a moderate approach to determining signiﬁcance level. Simulations reveal that critical values of multiple comparison tests with both the Bonferroni method and a modiﬁed FDR method approach a minimum asymptote very near zero as the number of tests gets large, but the Bonferroni method approaches zero much more rapidly than the modiﬁed FDR method. I compared pairwise signiﬁcance from three published studies using three critical values corresponding to Bonferroni, FDR, and modiﬁed FDR methods. Results suggest that the modiﬁed FDR method may provide the most biologically important critical value for evaluating signiﬁcance of population diﬀerentiation in conservation genetics. Ultimately, more thorough reporting of statistical signiﬁcance is needed to allow interpretation of biological signiﬁcance of genetic diﬀerentiation among populations.},

Thinking about the title early—and regularly returning to hone it—can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in “one contribution” that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.},

  abstract = {Though polyploidy is an important aspect of the evolutionary genetics of both plants and animals, the development of population genetic theory of polyploids has seriously lagged behind that of diploids. This is unfortunate since the analysis of polyploid genetic data—and the interpretation of the results—requires even more scrutiny than with diploid data. This is because of several polyploidy-specific complications in segregation and genotyping such as tetrasomy, double reduction, and missing dosage information. Here, we review the theoretical and statistical aspects of the population genetics of polyploids. We discuss several widely used types of inferences, including genetic diversity, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, population differentiation, genetic distance, and detecting population structure. For each, we point out how the statistical approach, expected result, and interpretation differ between different ploidy levels. We also discuss for each type of inference what biases may arise from the polyploid-specific complications and how these biases can be overcome. From our overview, it is clear that the statistical toolbox that is available for the analysis of genetic data is flexible and still expanding. Modern sequencing techniques will soon be able to overcome some of the current limitations to the analysis of polyploid data, though the techniques are lagging behind those available for diploids. Furthermore, the availability of more data may aggravate the biases that can arise, and increase the risk of false inferences. Therefore, simulations such as we used throughout this review are an important tool to verify the results of analyses of polyploid genetic data.},

  abstract = {Aim Mediterranean refugial areas are generally underrepresented in large-scale genetic surveys of forest trees. In the case of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), this has led to divergent hypotheses about the exact location of glacial refugia and the trajectory of recolonization routes. Based on the comprehensive sampling of Apennine populations, we aimed to reconcile discrepancies about the num- ber and location of refugia for silver fir in the Apennines and test alternative demographic scenarios developed from palaeobotanical and genetic data. Location Mediterranean Basin; the Apennines and surrounding areas. Methods 1167 individuals from 16 Apennine populations, extensively cover- ing the species' distribution along the Italian Peninsula, and eight populations from the Alps and Eastern Europe were genotyped at 16 nuclear and three chloroplast microsatellite markers. The geographical distribution of genetic variation was explored using Bayesian clustering and multivariate methods. Based on the inferred genetic structure, the demographic history of A. alba was assessed by the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analysis. Results Two unexpected characteristics of genetic structure emerged: a sharp genetic boundary in the central Apennines and a tight genetic connection between southern Apennine and Eastern European gene pools. Two Apennine areas, corresponding precisely with refugial areas hypothesized in most recent palaeobotanical syntheses, have high genetic diversity on a par with Eastern European populations. ABC analysis showed an ancient separation between Apennine and Eastern European gene pools followed by an admixture event that, mainly through directional gene flow via pollen, might have established the genetic similarity between southern Apennine and Eastern European popu- lations. In addition, there was evidence that the central Apennines acted as a small-scale, isolated refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum. Main conclusions Silver fir rear edge populations have experienced a com- plex demographic history across several glacial-interglacial cycles, leading to unexpected genetic structure. Our study provides new insights into forest tree dynamics in the Mediterranean, showing the putative presence of multiple refugia for silver fir in the Apennines and a trans-Adriatic connection between silver fir populations in the southern Italy and the Balkans.

  abstract = {Abies borisii-regis Mattfeld, is a taxon with a highly debated origin, nevertheless it is currently considered to be a hybrid fir, the result of introgression between silver fir (Abies alba Miller) and the endemic Greek fir (Abies cephalonica Loudon). The habitat characteristics and the ecological requirements of the parental species, as well as their anticipated response function to climatic change, are likely to be markedly different. An Abies borisii-regis population from Mt. Olympus, Greece is part of a forest genetic monitoring (FGM) assessment that also includes two to Abies alba populations from Slovenia and Germany. FGM is the quantification of temporal changes in population genetic variation and structure, which elucidates processes that maintain genetic variation in natural populations, and introduces prognosis, helping to define tools for forest gene conservation, policy and management. FGM is based on the temporal population assessment based on a system of indicators and verifiers. In the present study, 11nSSR loci and one cohort (adult trees) were used. More than half of the private alleles were detected in the Greek Abies borisii-regis population, a possible result of its association to the Abies cephalonica genome. In the analysis of the adult trees cohort, Abies borisii-regis presented higher effective number of alleles, allelic richness and inbreeding coefficient values compared to Abies alba, lower observed heterozygosity, while the expected heterozygosity value was intermediate between those of the Slovenian and German silver fir populations. The Abies borisii-regis population was the most differentiated as seen from different averaging and multivariate approaches. In the case where interspecific hybridization occurs, a hybridization index can form an important additional verifier for FGM assessment.},

  abstract = {Mutational processes of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in complex genomes are poorly understood. We examined these processes by introducing a two-phase mutation model. In this model, most mutations are single-step changes, but infrequent large jumps in repeat number also occur. We used computer simulations to determine expected values of statistics that reflect frequency distributions of allele size for the two-phase model and two alternatives, the one-step and geometric models. The theoretical expectations for each model were tested by comparison with observed values for 10 SSR loci genotyped in the Sardinian population, whose genetic and demographic histories have been previously reconstructed. The two-phase model provided the best fit to the data for most of these loci in this population. In the analysis we assumed that the loci were neutral and that this population had undergone rapid population growth. Recent observations made for unstable trinucleotide repeats support our suggestion that frequent small changes and rare large changes in repeat number represent two distinct classes of mutation at SSR loci. We genotyped the same 10 loci in Egyptian and sub-Saharan African samples to assess the utility of SSRs for studying the divergence of populations and found that estimates of interpopulation distances from SSRs were similar to those derived from analysis of mitochondrial DNA.},

  abstract = {The Hardy-Weinberg law plays an important role in the field of population genetics and often serves as a basis for genetic inference. Because of its importance, much attention has been devoted to tests of Hardy-Weinberg proportions (HWP) over the decades. It has long been recognized that large-sample goodness-of-fit tests can sometimes lead to spurious results when the sample size and/or some genotypic frequencies are small. Although a complete enumeration algorithm for the exact test has been proposed, it is not of practical use for loci with more than a few alleles due to the amount of computation required. We propose two algorithms to estimate the significance level for a test of HWP. The algorithms are easily applicable to loci with multiple alleles. Both are remarkably simple and computationally fast. Relative efficiency and merits of the two algorithms are compared. Guidelines regarding their usage are given. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the practicality of the algorithms.},

  abstract = {The present study examines the influence of ecological conditions and silvicultural practices on the health of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) stands, with special attention to the implications of Viscum album, Armillaria and Heterobasidion annosum. Health of individual trees was estimated by measuring defoliation, chlorosis, needle retention, cone production, stork nest, epicormic sprouting and lichen cover. For stand health we measured regeneration. We used a systematic sampling throughout the Spanish Pyrenees, and analyzed the data by means of mixed models. We observed damage on 15\% of the trees based on defoliation levels and on 10\% of the trees based on chlorosis. Defoliation, chlorosis and cone production were more frequent in dominant trees while epicormic sprouting was more concentrated in the dominated layer. Stork nest and lichen cover may be linked to low growth in low quality sites. The incidence of V. album on trees was 13.9\%, and positively related to defoliation and chlorosis. We did not find a clear relationship between H. annosum or Armillaria and decline symptoms. Both pathogens appeared to be widespread in silver fir forests. No regeneration difficulties were observed anywhere. At stand level silver fir does not seem to be a species in decline. Silver fir was favoured during the last period of intensive cuttings, whilst Pinus sylvestris and Pinus uncinata nearly disappeared. At tree level, fir decline and health problems are more localized and advanced on seed trees left after the last cuttings.},

Interspecific studies show that microsatellites are poor markers for phylogenetic inference.

The pollen data presented here confirm long-lasting refugial areas such as southern Italy and Greece already described in previous studies. The combined pollen/macrofossil dataset identifies the Pyrenees as a further important refugium. In addition the pollen data indicate potential refugia in south-east France and north-west Italy.

Adjusting the pH of water used for spectrophotometric analysis from approximately 5.4 to a slightly alkaline pH of 7.5-8.5 significantly increased RNA A260/280 ratios from approximately 1.5 to 2.0. Our studies revealed that changes in both the pH and ionic strength of the spectrophotometric solution influenced the A260/280 ratios. In addition, the ability to detect protein contamination was significantly improved when RNA was spectrophotometrically analyzed in an alkaline solution. UV spectral scans showed that the 260-nm RNA absorbance maximum observed in water was shifted by 2 nm to a lower wavelength when determinations were carried out in Na2HPO4 buffer at a pH of 8.5. We found RNA A260/280 ratios to be more reliable and reproducible when these spectrophotometric measurements were performed at pH 8.0-8.5 in 1-3 mM Na2HPO4 buffer.},

  abstract = {* Predicted climate change is heading in many respects into untested environmental conditions for trees and to the reshuffling of species distributions. We explore the consequences that these changes are likely to have on population differentiation of adaptive traits. Superimposed on the spatial redistribution of the species, will there be a redistribution of their genetic variation? * We base our predictions on a conceptual framework, whose elements are the extant differentiation, and the predicted divergent evolution of populations along purposely chosen altitudinal/latitudinal gradients. We consider simultaneously phenotypic and genetic divergence, but emphasize genetically driven population differentiation. We illustrate phenotypic and genetic patterns of variation with examples from well-studied northern and southern hemisphere tree genera Quercus and Eucalyptus. * Most phenotypic traits show very large in situ clinal variation with variation in altitude or latitude. Genetic clines detected in common gardens usually follow the observed in situ phenotypic clines, reflecting cogradient variation. Rare counter gradients have also been detected, where phenotypic and genetic clines exhibit opposing signs. These patterns suggest that plasticity and selection contributed in most cases synergistically to the extant differentiation. * We anticipate that microevolutionary processes will be different along environmental gradients. At the leading edge, availability of newly suitable habitats will trigger migration favouring genotypes equipped with colonists attributes. At the rear edges of the distribution, populations will be submitted to strong selective pressures favouring genotypes capable of withstanding drought and heat stress. Central populations will benefit from the plastic response of trees that will temporarily compensate for the maladaptation, until genetic adaptive variation will be restored by gene flow, mutation or recombination. * We make predictions about future differentiation along environmental gradients, by highlighting traits that are likely to diverge, the rate at which differentiation will take place, and the role of gene flow and hybridization. We envisage that parallel selection may maintain differentiation at extant levels, whereas divergent selection will promote substantial differentiation for traits facilitating adaptation to contrasting conditions along the environmental gradient. We anticipate that genetic divergence may occur very rapidly and will be enhanced by the multilocus architecture of most adaptive traits.},

  issn = {0018-067X},
  doi = {10.1038/hdy.2012.72},
  abstract = {Habitat fragmentation has been shown to disrupt ecosystem processes such as plant-pollinator mutualisms. Consequently, mating patterns in remnant tree populations are expected to shift towards increased inbreeding and reduced pollen diversity, with fitness consequences for future generations. However, mating patterns and phenotypic assessments of open-pollinated progeny have rarely been combined in a single study. Here, we collected seeds from 37 Eucalyptus incrassata trees from contrasting stand densities following recent clearance in a single South Australian population (intact woodland ¼ 12.6 trees ha À1 ; isolated pasture ¼ 1.7 trees ha À1 ; population area ¼ 10 km 2). 649 progeny from these trees were genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. We estimated genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure, indirect contemporary pollen flow and mating patterns for adults older than the clearance events and open-pollinated progeny sired post-clearance. A proxy of early stage progeny viability was assessed in a common garden experiment. Density had no impact on mating patterns, adult and progeny genetic diversity or progeny growth, but was associated with increased mean pollen dispersal. Weak spatial genetic structure among adults suggests high historical gene flow. We observed preliminary evidence for inbreeding depression related to stress caused by fungal infection, but which was not associated with density. Higher observed heterozygosities in adults compared with progeny may relate to weak selection on progeny and lifetime-accumulated mortality of inbred adults. E. incrassata appears to be resistant to the negative mating pattern and fitness changes expected within fragmented landscapes. This pattern is likely explained by strong outcrossing and regular long-distance pollen flow. INTRODUCTION Many tree species achieve far-reaching gene flow, particularly through the movement of pollen (Petit et al., 2005; Kremer et al., 2012). For this reason, some tree species have been observed to be buffered against the expected negative population genetic effects of habitat fragmentation, which are commonly exhibited by other organisms. In this 'paradox of forest fragmentation genetics' (Kramer et al., 2008), high intra-population genetic diversity is usually maintained for trees, even in seemingly challenging situations (Lowe et al., 2005; Bacles and Jump, 2011; Vranckx et al., 2011). However, within tree populations, the mating patterns of indivi-duals (for example, inbreeding, pollen diversity) can strongly influ-ence the gain or loss of genetic diversity over generations (Lowe et al., 2005). In fragmented tree populations, habitat loss and reduced stand density frequently disrupts pollination, which in turn alters mating patterns and gene flow dynamics (Ghazoul, 2005; Sork and Smouse, 2006). A common consequence of lower density is that altered pollination dynamics increases inbreeding (Lowe et al., 2005; Eckert et al., 2010; Breed et al., 2012) and/or reduces pollen diversity (Lowe et al., 2005; Breed et al., 2012). Nonetheless, this is not always the case (Bacles and Jump, 2011), and impacts can be highly context-dependent and affected by pollen vectors (Sork and Smouse, 2006; Eckert et al., 2010; Breed et al., 2012). To overcome this context-dependant effect, studies can investigate individuals within a single population that vary in their stand density (for example, Mimura et al., 2009; Llorens et al., 2012). This design controls for population effects that potentially influence tree responses to stand density, such as divergence in environmental (for example, pollinator community) and phenotypic (for example, mating system) traits. Elevated inbreeding may impose a fitness cost (that is, inbreeding depression), as increased homozygosity increases the probability that the phenotypes of deleterious recessive alleles (that is, genetic load) are expressed (Crnokrak and Barrett, 2002; Szulkin et al., 2010) and is expected to be most severe in stressful environments (Fox and Reed, 2010). Trees predominantly outcross, allowing them to accumulate genetic load, and are thus likely to exhibit inbreeding depression (Crnokrak and Barrett, 2002). Statistical associations between an offspring's heterozygosity at neutral genetic markers and its fitness are expected to occur because of changes to inbreeding rates due to disrupted pollinator behaviour. These heterozygosity–fitness correla-tions (HFCs) describe how variation in inbreeding (caused by nonrandom matings, small population sizes/bottlenecks or},

  abstract = {The provisioning of ecosystem services to society is increasingly under pressure from global change. Changing disturbance regimes are of particular concern in this context due to their high potential impact on ecosystem structure, function and composition. Resilience-based stewardship is advocated to address these changes in ecosystem management, but its operational implementation has remained challenging. We review observed and expected changes in disturbance regimes and their potential impacts on provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services, concentrating on temperate and boreal forests. Subsequently, we focus on resilience as a powerful concept to quantify and address these changes and their impacts, and present an approach towards its operational application using established methods from disturbance ecology. We suggest using the range of variability concept – characterizing and bounding the long-term behaviour of ecosystems – to locate and delineate the basins of attraction of a system. System recovery in relation to its range of variability can be used to measure resilience of ecosystems, allowing inferences on both engineering resilience (recovery rate) and monitoring for regime shifts (directionality of recovery trajectory). It is important to consider the dynamic nature of these properties in ecosystem analysis and management decision-making, as both disturbance processes and mechanisms of resilience will be subject to changes in the future. Furthermore, because ecosystem services are at the interface between natural and human systems, the social dimension of resilience (social adaptive capacity and range of variability) requires consideration in responding to changing disturbance regimes in forests. Synthesis and applications. Based on examples from temperate and boreal forests we synthesize principles and pathways for fostering resilience to changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. We conclude that future work should focus on testing and implementing these pathways in different contexts to make ecosystem services provisioning more robust to changing disturbance regimes and advance our understanding of how to cope with change and uncertainty in ecosystem management.},

Accordingly, characterization of forest genetic resources in managed vs non-managed stands may inform management decisions to ensure the long-term persistence of genetic diversity. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of management practices on the genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of contrasting forests, through an age-class sampling design and the use of microsatellite markers. We evaluated the impact of logging in three populations of Nothofagus pumilio, a dominant tree species in Patagonian temperate forests, by comparing managed and non-managed stands in each population. Selective extraction of best-featured individuals, i.e. those with forestry aptitude, such as higher trees with straight trunks and good sanitary conditions, was performed between 1990 and 2004. One of the studied sites was located in a state-protected area while the others were on private land affected by grazing. At each managed stand over-mature trees (MF-O), adult remnant trees (MF-A) and seedlings representing forest regeneration (MF-R) after silvicultural management were sampled. In non-managed stands age classes were restricted to adults (CF-A) and seedlings (CF-R). A minimum of 30 individuals per age class were collected, totalling 454 samples which were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. Non-significant differences in genetic diversity were found between managed and natural woods in all populations. A trend towards decreasing frequencies or even allele loss among remnant adults of logged stands can however be interpreted as a sign of impact, probably a consequence of genetic drift. Each site showed particular, different outcomes with respect to genetic structure. While in Pop 1 (Huemules, 42??S) significant genetic differentiation was found between management treatments, admixture of genetic clusters (Bayesian clustering and DAPC analysis) occurred in Pop 2 (Guacho Lake, 43??S) and no genetic structure was found in Pop 3 (Enga??o Lake, 43??S). Post-harvest genetic contact between contrasting stands is likely. A Landscape Interpolation Analysis showed clusters of individuals (shared genotypes) spatially restricted for managed stands (significant in Pop 3), whereas a random spatial distribution characterized control forests. Therefore, it is possible that management affected and disrupted the genetic structure. The different genetic patterns revealed for each population call for site-by-site interpretation. Differential intensity and frequency of management practices, presence/absence of livestock in the forest, and evolutionary history may all have had combined effect on current genetic diversity.},

To facilitate this process, a team of wildlife managers and animal behaviour researchers conducted a research prioritisation exercise, identifying 50 key questions that have great potential to resolve critical conservation and management problems.

In natural populations, purging and genetic rescue mitigate fitness decline during inbreeding periods, and might be critical to population survival, thus, both mechanisms should be considered when assessing extinction risks.

  title = {Genetic Aspects of Reforestation Practices for the Maximization of Forest Ecosystem Resilience},
  abstract = {The consequences of reforestation practices on the genetic variation and structure of forest tree populations are reviewed assessed and discussed, with a focus on the selection and handling of forest reproductive material. It emerges that averaging genetic diversity parameters, such as those typically reported in the assessment of forest population genetics, generally present some reduction when comparing populations established through reforestation and natural geographically proximal “control” populations. Even when differences are not substantial, subtler changes that regard the structure of genetic variation and the lasting adaptive potential of natural forest tree populations, are detected. Therefore, reforestation practices may have a longer‐term impact on the genetic diversity and structure of forest tree populations, and their assessment should be based on parameters that are sensitive to population perturbations and bottlenecks. In this respect, reforestation exerts a significant influence on the resilience of forest ecosystems, defined as their capacity to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change in order to retain essentially the same function (processes and properties), and ecosystem services. Neutral and adaptive genetic diversity provides a mechanism reinforcing both population perseverance and persistence of ecosystem functions and loss of genetic diversity may reduce resilience. To the level that genetic diversity affects species resilience, thegenetic changes found as a result of reforestation practices may eventually decrease fitness and exert some unfavorable influence on the resilience of forest ecosystems. The nature and extent of genetic effects and impact of reforestation, call for a concerted effort regarding their thorough study using genetic, genomic, as well as monitoring approaches, in order to provide insight and improve future practices.},

  abstract = {Persian or English walnut (Juglans regia L.), the walnut species cultivated for nut production, is one of the oldest food sources known. Persian walnuts, native to the mountain valleys of Central Asia, are grown worldwide in temperate areas. World production exceeds three million tons since 2012, mostly provided by China, the USA, and Iran. Despite very ancient culture of walnut species (Juglans spp.), breeding actually started in the twentieth century. Using a range of methodologies, from morphological markers to the most recent advances in genome analysis, many genetic studies of walnut have been conducted during the past 30 years, including examination of diversity, determination of relationships within or among germplasm collections and populations, phylogenetic and origin elucidation, genetic map construction, and biotic or abiotic stress investigations. The genetic improvement of walnut has undergone great evolution. The producing countries of the Middle East have widely studied morphological characteristics of walnut. The USA and France, for example, are behind important cultivar releases such as “Chandler” and “Franquette.” Finally, genomics represents a major breakthrough in walnut improvement, in particular by recent sequencing of both chloroplast and nuclear genomes. This review summarizes worldwide molecular and “omics” studies and gives an overview of the main walnut breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Common walnut (Juglans regia L) is an economically important species cultivated worldwide for its high-quality wood and nuts. It is generally accepted that after the last glaciation J. regia survived and grew in almost completely isolated stands in Asia, and that ancient humans dispersed walnuts across Asia and into new habitats via trade and cultural expansion. The history of walnut in Europe is a matter of debate, however. In this study, we estimated the genetic diversity and structure of 91 Eurasian walnut populations using 14 neutral microsatellites. By integrating fossil pollen, cultural, and historical data with population genetics, and approximate Bayesian analysis, we reconstructed the demographic history of walnut and its routes of dispersal across Europe. The genetic data confirmed the presence of walnut in glacial refugia in the Balkans and western Europe. We conclude that human-mediated admixture between Anatolian and Balkan walnut germplasm started in the Early Bronze Age, and between western Europe and the Balkans in eastern Europe during the Roman Empire. A population size expansion and subsequent decline in northeastern and western Europe was detected in the last five centuries. The actual distribution of walnut in Europe resulted from the combined effects of expansion/contraction from multiple refugia after the Last Glacial Maximum and its human exploitation over the last 5,000 years.},

Bilateral leaf morphometrics were used to estimate fluctuating asymmetry which refers to random deviation from perfect symmetry of bilateral traits resulting from extrinsic and intrinsic perturbations not buffered during development. Fluctuating asymmetry was used as a proxy of developmental stability. We analyzed our data from a Bayesian perspective showing that developmental stability levels are decreased in the natural population. Our results indicate that an attention may be directed towards the conservation of the natural walnut resources of the area. Fluctuating asymmetry as an indicator of developmental stability may contribute especially in the framework of comparative studies as a population biomonitoring tool.},

  abstract = {Context: No efficient method is available to compare multi-locus estimates of diversity while taking into account inter-locus and inter-population stochastic variance. The advent of genome scan approaches makes the development of such tests absolutely necessary. Aims: We developed a method to compare genome-wide diversity estimates while taking into account - and factoring out - variation in census size and making use of inter-locus variance to assess significance of differences in diversity levels. Methods: An approach based on rarefaction with bootstrap re-sampling (RaBoT) was implemented into a test of multi-locus comparison of diversity coded in R. The properties of the test were studied by applying it to simulated populations with varying diversity levels and varying differences in diversity levels. The test was then applied to empirical data from disturbed and undisturbed populations of Virola michelii (Myristicaceae) genotyped at 693 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Results: RaBoT was found to be rather conservative, with large numbers of false negatives when the diversity in the compared populations was similar, and false positives mostly associated to comparisons of populations with extremely high levels of diversity. When applied to empirical data, RaBoT detected higher genetic diversity in a post-disturbance than in an undisturbed population and lower genetic diversity in a seedling than in the corresponding adult population, but it also revealed differences in diversity between subgroups within the disturbed and undisturbed plots. Conclusion: RaBoT is a sensitive method to compare multi-locus levels of diversity that can be applied both at the genotype level for dominant markers (e.g. AFLP) and at the allele level for biallelic codominant markers (e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphisms). © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admired individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g., seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

  abstract = {Forest trees are an unparalleled group of organisms in their combined ecological, economic and societal importance. With widespread distributions, predominantly random mating systems and large population sizes, most tree species harbour extensive genetic variation both within and among populations. At the same time, demographic processes associated with Pleistocene climate oscillations and land-use change have affected contemporary range-wide diversity and may impinge on the potential for future adaptation. Understanding how these adaptive and neutral processes have shaped the genomes of trees species is therefore central to their management and conservation. As for many other taxa, the advent of high-throughput sequencing methods is expected to yield an understanding of the interplay between the genome and environment at a level of detail and depth not possible only a few years ago. An international conference entitled ‘Genomics and Forest Tree Genetics' was held in May 2016, in Arcachon (France), and brought together forest geneticists with a wide range of research interests to disseminate recent efforts that leverage contemporary genomic tools to probe the population, quantitative and evolutionary genomics of trees. An important goal of the conference was to discuss how such data can be applied to both genome-enabled breeding and the conservation of forest genetic resources under land use and climate change. Here, we report discoveries presented at the meeting and discuss how the ecological genomic toolkit can be used to address both basic and applied questions in tree biology.},

  abstract = {Although FST is widely used as a measure of population structure, it has been criticized recently because of its dependency on within-population diversity. This dependency can lead to difficulties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F′ST and D. F′ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, F′ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4 years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F′ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased F′ST estimator based on GST, which we call G′′ST. However, F′ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F′ST or D. In most cases, F′ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the influence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

Relation between genetic diversity$\backslash$nand mass production of forest reproductive material is discussed in a$\backslash$nholistic manner. In industrial forest plantations, narrow genetic$\backslash$ndiversity is desirable and reproductive material is produced at clone$\backslash$nlevel. On the other hand, in conservation forestry a wide genetic$\backslash$ndiversity is imperative. Beside management goals, a desirable level ofŋenetic diversity is related to rotation cycle and ontogeny of tree$\backslash$nspecies. Risks of failure are lower in short rotations of fast growing$\backslash$nspecies. In production of slow growing species, managed in long$\backslash$nrotations, the reduction of genetic diversity increases the risk of$\backslash$nfailure due to causes unknown or unexpected at the time of planting.$\backslash$nThis risk is additionally increased in cases of seed transfer and in$\backslash$nconditions of climate change. Every step in production of forest$\backslash$nreproductive material, from collection to nursery production, has an$\backslash$neffect on genetic diversity mainly by directional selection and should$\backslash$nbe considered. This review revealed no consistent decrease of genetic$\backslash$ndiversity during forest reproductive material production and planting.},

  abstract = {Reforestation schemes, which encompass environmental plantings and natural regeneration of vegetation on cleared land, are increasingly being established for the purposes of mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions. However, these schemes are themselves at risk from climate change and associated changes in disturbance regimes. Simultaneously, there is increasing pressure on reforested areas to achieve multiple co-benefits, e.g. maximizing carbon storage, ameliorating environmental degradation and promoting biodiversity objectives, all while not adversely affecting community values, such as agricultural production. Here, we review the myriad of biophysical risks posed by climate change to reforested areas while documenting management actions and policies that can enhance both the resistance and resilience of reforested areas to such risks. While it is difficult to buffer vegetation against the direct effects of climate change, such as elevated temperature and changed precipitation patterns, it is possible to manage some of the indirect effects, such as wildfire, drought and insect defoliation. Methods for reducing the vulnerability of reforested areas range from site-specific management actions, particularly around design and location, through to regional and national scale initiatives, such as vulnerability assessments and decision support tools. The complexity of objectives and risks posed to reforested areas means that it is vitally important to evaluate outcomes from across the current estate of reforested areas. However, there is currently no national protocol in place in Australia to track, monitor or evaluate the outcomes of reforestation. Thus, we recommend the establishment of a national framework for analyzing and supporting the growing range of reforestation activities.},

  abstract = {To empirically determine the effects of sample size on commonly used measures of average genetic diversity, we genotyped 200 song sparrows Melospiza melodia from two populations, one genetically depauperate (n 0100) and the other genetically diverse (n 0100), using eight microsatellite loci. These genotypes were used to randomly create 10,000 datasets of differing sizes (5 to 50) for each population to determine what the effects of sample size might be on several estimates of genetic diversity (number of alleles per locus, average observed heterozygosity, and unbiased average expected heterozygosity) in natural populations of conservation concern. We found that at small sample sizes of 5 to 10 individuals, estimates of unbiased heterozygosity outperformed those based on observed heterozygosity or allelic diversity for both low-and high-diversity populations. We also found that when comparing across populations in which different numbers of individuals were sampled, rarefaction provided a useful way to compare estimates of allelic diversity. We recommend that standard errors should be reported for all diversity estimators, especially when sample sizes are small. We also recommend that at least 20 to 30 individuals be sampled in microsatellite studies that assess genetic diversity when working in a population that has an unknown level of diversity. However, research on critically endangered populations (where large sample sizes are impossible or extremely difficult to obtain) should include measures of genetic diversity even if sample sizes are less than ideal. These estimates can be useful in assessing the genetic diversity of the population.},

  abstract = {Data from multilocus enzyme electrophoresis of bacterial populations were analyzed using a statistical test designed to detect associations between genes at different loci. Some species (e.g., SalmoneUa) were found to be clonal at all levels of analysis. At the other extreme, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is panmictic, with random association between loci. Two intermediate types of population structure were also found. Neisseria meningitidis displays what we have called an "epi-demic" structure. There is significant association between loci, but this arises only because of the recent, explosive, increase in particular electrophoretic types; when this effect is eliminated the population is found to be effectively panmictic. In contrast, linkage disequilibrium in a population of Rhizobium meliloti exists because the sample consisted of two genetically isolated divisions, often fixed for different alleles: within each division association between loci was almost random. The method of analysis is appropriate whenever there is doubt about the extent of genetic recombination between members of a population. To illustrate this we analyzed data on protozoan parasites and again found panmictic, epidemic, and clonal population struc-tures.},

  abstract = {Ordination in reduced space is often referred to as factor (or inertia) analysis because it is based on the extraction of the eigenvectors or factors of the association matrix. The chapter provides a description of the domains of application of the ordination methods, which include principal component analysis (PCA), principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS). PCA is a powerful technique for ordination in reduced space which is, however, limited to sets of quantitative descriptors. Results are also sensitive to the presence of double-zeros. PCoA (metric scaling) and nonmetric MDS, respectively project, in reduced space, the distances among objects computed using some appropriate association measure. Correspondence analysis is useful ordination technique for species presence/absence or abundance data. Correspondence analysis can also be conducted on contingency tables that compare two groups of descriptors. The analysis of the relationships among the descriptors of a multidimensional data matrix is carried out by factor analysis. The two types of factor analysis are exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis.},

  abstract = {The association of alleles among different loci was studied in natural populations of Hordeum spontaneum, the evolutionary progenitor of cultivated barley. The variance of the number of heterozygous loci in two randomly chosen gametes affords a useful measure of such association. The behavior of this statistic in several particular models is described. Generally, linkage (ga-metic phase) disequilibrium tends to increase the variance above the value expected under complete independence. This increase is greatest when dis-equilibria are such as to maximize the sum of squares of the two-locus gametic frequencies.-When data on several loci per individual are available, the ob-served variance may be tested for its agreement with that expected under the hypothesis of complete interlocus independence, using the sampling theory of this model. When applied to allozyme data from 26 polymorphic populations of wild barley, this test demonstrated the presence of geographically widespread multilocus organization. On average, the variance was 80\% higher than ex-pected under random association. Gametic frequencies for four esterase loci in both of these populations of wild barley and two composite crosses of culti-vated barley were analyzed. Most generations of the composites showed less multilocus structure, as measured by the indices of association, than the wild populations.

  abstract = {Domestication has been influenced by formal plant breeding since the onset of intensive agriculture and the Green Revolution. Despite providing food security for some regions, intensive agriculture has had substantial detrimental consequences for the environment and does not fulfill smallholder's needs under most developing countries conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to look for alternative plant production techniques, effective for each environmental, socio-cultural and economic conditions. This is particularly relevant for countries that are megadiverse and major centers of plant domestication and diversification. In this white paper, a Mexico-centered initiative is proposed, with two main objectives: (1) to study, understand, conserve, and sustainably use the genetic diversity of domesticated plants and their wild relatives, as well as the ongoing evolutionary processes that generate and maintain it; and (2) to strengthen food and forestry production in a socially fair and environmentally friendly way. To fulfill these objectives, the initiative focuses on the source of variability available for domestication (genetic diversity and functional genomics), the context in which domestication acts (breeding and production) and one of its main challenges (environmental change). Research on these components can be framed to target and connect both the theoretical understanding of the evolutionary processes, the practical aspects of conservation, and food and forestry production. The target, main challenges, problems to be faced and key research questions are presented for each component, followed by a roadmap for the consolidation of this proposal as a national initiative.},

We used both the infinite-allele model (IAM) and the stepwise mutation model (SMM), which seem to be appropriate for classical markers and microsatellite loci, respectively. The results show that in both the IAM and SMM CAVALLI-SFORZA and EDWARDS' chord distance (Dc) and NEI et al.'s DA distance generally show higher PC values than other distance measures, whether the bottleneck effect exists or not.

  abstract = {Multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis were among the first statistical methods employed to extract information from genetic markers. From their early applications to current innovations, these approaches have proven to be efficient for the analysis of the genetic variability in various contexts such as human genetics, conservation and adaptation studies. However, because multivariate analysis is a wide and diversified area of statistics, choosing a method appropriate to both the data and to the question being asked can be difficult. Moreover, some particularities of genetic markers need to be taken into account when using multivariate methods. As a consequence, multivariate analyses are often used as black boxes, which results in frequent mistakes in the literature. In this review, we provide a critical analysis of the application of multivariate methods to genetic markers, using a general framework that unifies all these methods for the sake of clarity. First, we focus on some common mistakes in these applications and ways to avoid these pitfalls. We then detail the most critical particularities of allele frequencies that demand adaptations of multivariate methods, and we propose solutions to the subsequent problems. Finally, we tackle several questions of interest in which multivariate analysis has a great role to play, such as the study of the typological coherence of different genetic markers, or the investigation of spatial genetic patterns.},

We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

  abstract = {Working with weakly congruent markers means that consensus genetic structuring of populations requires methods explicitly devoted to this purpose. The method, which is presented here, belongs to the multivariate analyses. This method consists of different steps. First, single-marker analyses were performed using a version of principal component analysis, which is designed for allelic frequencies (\%PCA). Drawing confidence ellipses around the population positions enhances \%PCA plots. Second, a multiple co-inertia analysis (MCOA) was performed, which reveals the common features of single-marker analyses, builds a reference structure and makes it possible to compare single-marker structures with this reference through graphical tools. Finally, a typological value is provided for each marker. The typological value measures the efficiency of a marker to structure populations in the same way as other markers. In this study, we evaluate the interest and the efficiency of this method applied to a European and African bovine microsatellite data set. The typological value differs among markers, indicating that some markers are more efficient in displaying a consensus typology than others. Moreover, efficient markers in one collection of populations do not remain efficient in others. The number of markers used in a study is not a sufficient criterion to judge its reliability.

  abstract = {The dramatic progress in sequencing technologies offers unprecedented prospects for deciphering the organization of natural populations in space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations. We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza. Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets.},

We developed the R package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions include calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations.

This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {The number of marker loci required to answer a given research question satisfactorily is especially important for dominant markers since they have a lower information content than co-dominant marker systems. In this study, we used simulated dominant marker data sets to determine the number of dominant marker loci needed to obtain satisfactory results from two popular population genetic analyses: STRUCTURE and AMOVA (analysis of molecular variance). Factors such as migration, level of population differentiation, and unequal sampling were varied in the data sets to mirror a range of realistic research scenarios. AMOVA performed well under all scenarios with a modest quantity of markers while STRUCTURE required a greater number, especially when populations were closely related. The popular ΔK method of determining the number of genetically distinct groups worked well when sampling was balanced, but underestimated the true number of groups with unbalanced sampling. These results provide a window through which to interpret previous work with dominant markers and we provide a protocol for determining the number of markers needed for future dominant marker studies.},

The genetic diversity of thirty six summer squash landraces from Greece was investigated here using start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphism and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. In this study, we compared the informativeness and efficiency of the SCoT and ISSR molecular markers. ISSR markers were found to be more polymorphic with an average PIC value of 0.237, while SCoT markers showed the highest marker index (1.503). Cluster analysis on combined set of SCoT and ISSR genotyping data classified summer squash landraces in six distinct groups. The obtained PCoA (Principal Coordinate Analysis) scatter plots further supported the dendrogram results in a robust way. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed comparison of performance among the targeted DNA region molecular markers (SCoT) and the ISSR technique on a set of samples of C. pepo. The high genetic diversity existing in the Greek germplasm suggested that it would be beneficial to utilize this pool in summer squash breeding programs and germplasm management activities, in order to maximize genetic diversity in cultivated squash.},

The study was conducted in Cholomontas mountain, northern Greece at altitudes of 760–870m. Genetic material from Southern and Northwestern exposures and from different grazing intensities within each exposure, was studied using ISSR molecular markers. The plant cover at each study site was measured and the floristic composition of the site was calculated. The grazing intensity affected the species composition and reduced the abundance of T. sibthorpii. The floristic diversity in terms of species richness, evenness and Shannon index (IF) was higher at the southern sites. Within population gene diversity (HE) ranged from 0.203 to 0.245 and Shannon index (IG) from 0.311 to 0.377. Most of the genetic diversity resided within populations (88\%). Significant genetic differentiation was detected among the populations from the southern and northwestern sites, as well as among populations of each exposure. Genetic diversity of T. sibthorpii was not correlated to species diversity (richness and evenness), either within or between populations. Instead, genetic diversity was found to be positively correlated with environmental factors, such as N soil content and soil moisture.},

Numerous metrics have been applied to quantify resilience over a range of ecosystems. However, the way resilience is quantified affects the degree to which different trajectories of ecosystem recovery from disturbance are represented as ‘resilient', precluding a comparison of disturbance responses across ecosystems and their properties and functions. To approach a broadly comparable assessment of resilience we suggest using a bivariate framework that jointly considers the disturbance impact and the recovery rate, both normalized to the undisturbed state of a system. We demonstrate the potential of the framework for attribution and integration across the various components underlying resilience.},

  abstract = {Where conservation resources are limited and conservation targets are diverse, robust yet flexible priority-setting frameworks are vital. Priority-setting is especially important for geographically widespread species with distinct populations subject to multiple threats that operate on different spatial and temporal scales. Marine turtles are widely distributed and exhibit intra-specific variations in population sizes and trends, as well as reproduction and morphology. However, current global extinction risk assessment frameworks do not assess conservation status of spatially and biologically distinct marine turtle Regional Management Units (RMUs), and thus do not capture variations in population trends, impacts of threats, or necessary conservation actions across individual populations. To address this issue, we developed a new assessment framework that allowed us to evaluate, compare and organize marine turtle RMUs according to status and threats criteria. Because conservation priorities can vary widely (i.e. from avoiding imminent extinction to maintaining long-term monitoring efforts) we developed a “conservation priorities portfolio” system using categories of paired risk and threats scores for all RMUs (n = 58). We performed these assessments and rankings globally, by species, by ocean basin, and by recognized geopolitical bodies to identify patterns in risk, threats, and data gaps at different scales. This process resulted in characterization of risk and threats to all marine turtle RMUs, including identification of the world's 11 most endangered marine turtle RMUs based on highest risk and threats scores. This system also highlighted important gaps in available information that is crucial for accurate conservation assessments. Overall, this priority-setting framework can provide guidance for research and conservation priorities at multiple relevant scales, and should serve as a model for conservation status assessments and priority-setting for widespread, long-lived taxa.},

  abstract = {Mixed mating, where a single tree progeny results from a mixture of selfing and outcrossing, is widespread in conifers and could be an evolutionary advantage at ecological margins when mating partners become scarce. This study analyzes how the mating system responds to bioclimate and density variations. We surveyed published data on the mating system of Abies, Picea and Pinus species when information on bioclimate and stand density was available. Our survey revealed that Mediterranean species demonstrate a lower selfing rate than other species and that the proportion of selfed versus outcrossed progeny is not fixed within species. The highest variability in mating types within populations was found when stand density was the most variable. To show how density affects the proportion of selfed versus outcrossed progeny, we used isozymes to genotype single tree seeds from a marginal Abies alba forest in Mediterranean France (Mont Ventoux) where low-to high-density stands are found. We then tested the adaptive potential of the different high and low density progenies by sowing them under controlled nursery conditions and measuring germination rate and seedling survival after 4 years under 3 different water regimes. Although the mean value of outcrossing rate was typical for mixed mating conifers (tm = 0.85), individual outcrossing rates varied from 0.05 to 0.99 and were strongly correlated with stand type and density (tm from 0.87 in high-density to 0.43 in low-density marginal stands). Significantly fewer seeds from the low density marginal stand germinated (32\% vs 53\% in the high density mature stand), although seedlings from the marginal stand had a better 4-year survival (81\%) than seedlings from the high-density mature stand (63\%) when the three water regimes (from least to most stressful) were averaged. Trees from low density stands may be at a selective disadvantage because they produce more selfed progeny than trees from high-density stands. However, selfed seeds may be purged early on (at the embryo stage) and the remaining seeds tend to produce seedlings with better fitness. Variability of the selfing rate might thus be an adaptive strategy for species in highly contrasted environments where selection of both reproductive assurance and avoidance of inbreeding depression may be density dependent.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim The genus Abies exemplifies plant diversification related to long-term climatic, geological and evolutionary changes. Today, the Mediterranean firs comprise nine species, one natural hybrid and several varieties. Here I summarize current knowledge concerning the origin and evolution of the genus Abies in the Mediterranean Basin and propose a comprehensive hypothesis to explain the isolation and speciation pattern of Mediterranean firs. Location The Mediterranean Basin. Methods The literature on Abies was reviewed, focusing on the morphology, fossil records, molecular ecology, phytosociology and biogeography of the genus in the Mediterranean Basin. Results Abies fossils from the western Mediterranean indicate a wide Tertiary circum-Mediterranean distribution of the Abies ancestor. Palaeogeographical data also suggest a single eastern Mediterranean Tertiary ancestor. Following the Miocene to Pliocene climate crisis and marine transgressions, the ancestor of the northern Mediterranean firs is hypothesized to have separated into two eastern groups, one on the Balkan Peninsula and the other in Asia Minor. However, land bridges may have permitted gene flow at times. A southward migration of A. alba to refugia, where older fir species may have remained isolated since the Miocene, could explain recent findings indicating that morphologically distant species are more closely related than expected based on such morphological classification. Main conclusions The Abies genus appears to have undergone significant morphological differentiation that does not necessarily imply reproductive isolation. That is, long-term Mediterranean Basin dryness along a south-eastern to north-western gradient may have caused an initial Miocene–Pliocene speciation sequence. Pleistocene glacial cycles probably forced migrations to occur, leading to repeated contact between fir species in glacial refugia},

  abstract = {The conservation and sustainable use of forests and forest genetic resources (FGR) is a challenging task for scientists and foresters. Forest management practices can affect diversity on various levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem. Understanding past natural disturbance dynamics and their level of dependence on human disturbances and management practices is essential for the conservation and management of FGR, especially in the light of climate change. In this review, forest management practices and their impact on genetic composition are reviewed, synthesized, and interpreted in the light of existing national and international forest monitoring schemes and concepts from various European projects. There is a clear need and mandate for forest genetic monitoring (FGM), while the requirements thereof lack complementarity with existing forest monitoring. Due to certain obstacles (e.g., the lack of unified FGM implementation procedures across the countries, high implementation costs, large number of indicators and verifiers for FGM proposed in the past), merging FGM with existing forest monitoring is complicated. Nevertheless, FGM is of paramount importance for forestry and the natural environment in the future, regardless of the presence or existence of other monitoring systems, as it provides information no other monitoring system can yield. FGM can provide information related to adaptive and neutral genetic diversity changes over time, on a species and/or on a population basis and can serve as an early warning system for the detection of potentially harmful changes of forest adaptability. In addition, FGM offers knowledge on the adaptive potential of forests under the changing environment, which is important for the long-term conservation of FGR.},

  abstract = {Homoplasy (convergence in the size of different alleles) at microsatellite loci was examined by sequencing multiple alleles of two compound microsatellites and single copies of alleles of the same size at two other compound loci in both chimpanzees and humans. At one of the two loci for which multiple alleles were sequenced, extensive homoplasy for size was uncovered both within and between species. At the three loci for which alleles of the same size were examined in the two species, sequencing demonstrated different internal structures. These results confirm theoretical predictions that a certain fraction of mutations at microsatellite loci should produce alleles that are identical in size but differ by a number of mutations. The sequence data reveal a previously unrecognized class of variation at microsatellites and open up the possibility that DNA sequencing may allow the extraction of more information from these loci, thus increasing their power as variable markers for genetic mapping studies. Conversely, the data also indicate that the assumption that alleles of the same size are identical in sequence, which is implicit in several methods of analysis, is violated in some cases. Therefore, caution should be used when employing microsatellites in phylogenetic and other studies in which the individuals being examined are separated by a great number of generations from a common ancestor.},

Next, we performed assignment tests using blind samples (n = 12, microsatellites) and leave one out cross validation (LOOCV, isotopes). Isotopic composition varied strongly within concessions and only δ13C differed significantly between two concessions. As a result, LOOCV performed only marginally better than random. Genetic differentiation among provenances was also relatively low, but private alleles were commonly found. Bayesian clustering analysis correctly assigned 92\% of the blind samples, including those of nearby concessions. Thus, Tali timber can be successfully assigned to the concession of origin using genetic markers, but not using isotopic composition. Isotopic differentiation may be possible at larger spatial scales or with stronger climatic or topographic variation. Our study shows that genetic analyses can differentiate the geographic origin of tropical timber at the scale of forest concessions, demonstrating their potential as forensic tools to enforce timber trade legislation.},

For this purpose, the basic notions of physiological and evolutionary adaptive potential are briefly discussed in connection with operating and latent genetic potentials of populations. A measure for the quantification of latent genetic potential is introduced together with a procedure that evaluates the detective power of the samples taken. The results obtained from application of this measure are in striking accordance with earlier suggestions based chiefly on ecophysiological traits, and which assume both low physiological and evolutionary adaptive potential in the central and northeastern European populations of silver fir. Moreover, careful consideration of the structural and functional characteristics of the enzymes used in the present study support the assumption that they are not selectively neutral, and in one case it can indeed be demonstrated that the two alleles at a locus are very likely to be under selection for temperature differences between central and southern European populations.},

To provide benchmarks and indicators for monitoring genetic changes due to recent and future bottleneck events and to assist development of conservation strategies, we assessed genetic diversity and structure of six small, isolated white pine populations from two regions at the limits of its geographical range in Newfoundland for comparison with three populations from its central range in Ontario for 20 allozyme loci coding for 12 enzymes. On average, 47.8\% of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was 1.75, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.215 and 0.195, respectively. Although most of the alleles were widespread, unique alleles were found in three of the nine populations examined. The Newfoundland populations were as genetically variable as those from Ontario. Generally, all populations exhibited slight excess of heterozygotes at most loci. Only 6.1\% of the detected genetic variation was among populations, and the remainder among individuals within populations. The genetic distances among the populations within a province or region were as great as those among populations between the provinces or regions. Canonical discriminant functions and cluster analysis from genetic distances separated nine populations into the same four groups. Neither provincial nor regional or geographic gradient-related patterns of population variation and differentiation were apparent. It appears that 8000 years of postglacial geographic isolation and recent population decline have had little or no detectable effect on genetic diversity or differentiation of disjunct Newfoundland white pine populations from their ancestral mainland populations. Assuming their adaptability, the Ontario seed sources may be acceptable for white pine restoration in Newfoundland.},

However, sample sizes often differ across populations, sometimes making it difficult to assess allelic distributions across groups. Results: We introduce a generalized rarefaction approach for counting alleles private to combinations of populations. Our method evaluates the number of alleles found in each of a set of populations but absent in all remaining populations, considering equal-sized subsamples from each population. Applying this method to a worldwide human microsatellite dataset, we observe a high number of alleles private to the combination of African and Oceanian populations. This result supports the possibility of a migration out of Africa into Oceania separate from the migrations responsible for the majority of the ancestry of the modern populations of Asia, and it highlights the utility of our approach to sample size correction in evaluating hypotheses about population history.

  title = {Analysis of {{Population Subdivision}}},
  isbn = {0-470-84829-4},
  abstract = {This chapter reviews the basic measures of intraspecific population subdivision, without assuming any particular spatial model. The structure of the chapter follows from the historical development of the field, starting with the presentation of Wright's fixation indexes as correlations of gene frequencies, then Nei's extension of F -statistics to multiple alleles as function of heterozygosities and his introduction of G-statistics as function of gene diversities, and ending with Cockerham's intraclass correlations obtained under an analysis of variance framework. We also present an extension of the analysis of variance approach to handle molecular data (DNA sequences, microsatellites) as well as dominant data. The relationships between different estimators, different approaches and their potential limitations are discussed. 24.1 INTRODUCTION Species or populations usually do not constitute a single panmictic unit where individuals breed at random over the whole species range. Rather they are subdivided into smaller entities, which can be arranged in space, time, ecology or otherwise. Different levels of population subdivisions may exist, which may be hierarchically arranged or not. A population can thus be divided into groups or regions, themselves divided into smaller units, and so on until we reach a basic unit of population that may be treated as a homogeneous group, a fundamental unit called a deme (Gilmour and Gregor, 1939) or, in the context of continuous habitats, a neighborhood (Wright, 1946). Even within demes, individuals are often related to each other, due to some shared ancestry and finite deme sizes, which introduces some local levels of inbreeding often resulting in homozygote excess. Population structure, if not properly recognized, can affect our interpretation of the observed pattern of genetic diversity, and can often mimic the effect of selection. Wahlund (1928) thus showed that hidden subdivision leads to an apparent excess of homozygotes (see also Nagylaki, 1985). When several loci are considered, population subdivision can},

A variety of DNA preparation methods and commercial kits are available. However, they are either low throughput, low yield, or costly. Here, we describe a method for high throughput genomic DNA isolation from sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

The method yielded large quantity and high quality DNA from both lyophilized sorghum leaves and dry seeds. The DNA yield was improved by nearly 30 fold with 4 times less consumption of MagAttract beads. The method can also be used in other plant species, including cotton leaves and pine needles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: A high throughput system for DNA extraction from sorghum leaves and seeds was developed and validated.

However, sample size evaluation requires previous knowledge of allele frequencies estimated with precision and this is not often the case. • Here, we evaluated sample size requirements for accurate genetic diversity in adult trees and family arrays in a 12 ha plot of Fraxinus excelsior L. (Oleaceae) in a community forest in central France. Data consisted of 579 adult trees and 480 offspring from 24 families genotyped at four nuclear microsatellites. • Mean square errors (MSE) estimates performed on Monte Carlo simulations of resampled data indicated that several adult individuals ($>$ 300) are necessary for accurate measures of allele richness. However, expected heterozygosity requires smaller samples ($<$ 30). Seeds captured about 90\% of adult allelic diversity requiring a sampling effort roughly 50\% larger than that of adult trees (480 seeds vs. 300 adults) suggesting that seed sampling is heavily penalized for allele counts. Nevertheless, gene diversity of seeds was essentially identical to that of the adult population. • Extrapolation of these results to other ash tree populations appears feasible because of similar levels of diversity reported in the literature but it is not granted for species with significant selfing or high genetic structure. © 2008 INRA, EDP Sciences.},

In this study, we investigate a species in Britain that has experienced both negative impact through overhunting in historical times and management efforts through culls and translocations. At the same time, there are regional populations that have been less affected by human influence. We use mtDNA and nuclear microsatellite DNA markers to investigate patterns of connectivity and diversity and find multiple insular populations in Britain that probably evolved within the Holocene (when the habitat was free of ice). We identify three concurrent processes. First, surviving indigenous populations show highly provincial patterns of philopatry, maintaining and generating population structure on a small geographic scale. Second, founder populations into habitat extirpated of native populations have expanded, but remained largely insular. Third, introductions into established populations generate some admixture.

Many methods have been developed in the past three decades to estimate the current, past and ancient effective population sizes using different information extracted from some genetic markers in a sample of individuals. This paper reviews the methodologies proposed for estimating Ne from genetic data using information on heterozygosity excess, linkage disequilibrium, temporal changes in allele frequency, and pattern and amount of genetic variation within and between populations. For each methodology, I describe mainly the logic and genetic model on which it is based, the data required and information used, the interpretation of the estimate obtained, some results from applications to simulated or empirical datasets and future developments that are needed.},

For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediter- ranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest propor- tional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plau- sible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {In today's age of genomic discovery, no attempt has been made to comprehensively sequence a gymnosperm genome. The largest genus in the coniferous family Pinaceae is Pinus, whose 110-120 species have extremely large genomes (c. 20-40 Gb, 2N = 24). The size and complexity of these genomes have prompted much speculation as to the feasibility of completing a conifer genome sequence. Conifer genomes are reputed to be highly repetitive, but there is little information available on the nature and identity of repetitive units in gymnosperms. The pines have extensive genetic resources, with approximately 329000 ESTs from eleven species and genetic maps in eight species, including a dense genetic map of the twelve linkage groups in Pinus taeda. We present here the Sanger sequence and annotation of ten P. taeda BAC clones and Genome Analyzer II whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences representing 7.5\% of the genome. Computational annotation of ten BACs predicts three putative protein-coding genes and at least fifteen likely pseudogenes in nearly one megabase of sequence. We found three conifer-specific LTR retroelements in the BACs, and tentatively identified at least 15 others based on evidence from the distantly related angiosperms. Alignment of WGS sequences to the BACs indicates that 80\% of BAC sequences have similar copies (≥ 75\% nucleotide identity) elsewhere in the genome, but only 23\% have identical copies (99\% identity). The three most common repetitive elements in the genome were identified and, when combined, represent less than 5\% of the genome. This study indicates that the majority of repeats in the P. taeda genome are 'novel' and will therefore require additional BAC or genomic sequencing for accurate characterization. The pine genome contains a very large number of diverged and probably defunct repetitive elements. This study also provides new evidence that sequencing a pine genome using a WGS approach is a feasible goal.},

  abstract = {Abies nebrodensis (Lojac.) Mattei (Sicilian fir) is a forest tree species endemic to the mountainous regions of northern Sicily (the Madonie Range) that is currently represented by just one population of 29 individuals. The major questions relating to this species are its unknown origin and its uncertain taxonomic position. According to many authors A. nebrodensis is morphologically intermediate between the neighboring Mediterranean Abies species: Abies alba (Mill.) (silver fir), Abies numidica (De Lann) (Algerian fir) and Abies cephalonica (Loud.) (Greek fir). In the present study we analyzed eight enzyme systems in the population of A. nebrodensis and in seven populations from A. alba, A. cephalonica and A. numidica. The aim was to clarify the taxonomic position and origin of A. nebrodensis. High values of expected heterozygosity and number of polymorphic loci were found in A. cephalonica, while A. alba and A. nebrodensis showed intermediate levels of polymorphism and A. numidica was the least variable species. All values were similar to those found in other conifers. The relatively high level of diversity found in A. nebrodensis confirms that despite the extremely small population size, the few individuals left in this species still retain a considerable amount of the original genetic variation at the nuclear level. Results also showed that all the species were differentiated from each other, although A. nebrodensis showed a closer affinity to A. alba and in particular to the population from southern Italy. Our results, together with results from previous studies provide support for the classification of A. nebrodensis as a separate taxon and suggest that this species may have originated through a past hybridization event.},

  abstract = {Recent studies clarify where the most vulnerable species live, where and how humanity changes the planet, and how this drives extinctions. We assess key statistics about species, their distribution, and their status. Most are undescribed. Those we know best have large geographical ranges and are often common within them. Most known species have small ranges. The numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly, even in well-known taxa. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. Current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the likely background rate of extinction. Future rates depend on many factors and are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. O ne of the four functions of the Intergov-ernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bio-diversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is to " perform regular and timely assess-ments of knowledge on biodiversity " (1). In December 2013, its second plenary session ap-proved starting global and regional assessments in 2015 (1). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and five other biodiversity-related conven-tions have adopted IPBES as their science-policy interface, so these assessments will be important in evaluating progress toward the CBD's Aichi Targets of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011– 2020 (2). They will necessarily follow the defi-nitions of biodiversity by the CBD introduced by Norse et al. (3) as spanning genetic, species, and ecosystem levels of ecological organization. As a contribution, we review the biodiversity of eu-karyote species and their extinction rates, dis-tributions, and protection. Interestingly, several targets explicitly mention " known species " —a strong, if implicit statement of incomplete knowledge. So how many eukary-ote species are there (4)? For land plants, there are 298,900 accepted species' names, 477,601 syn-onyms, and 263,925 names unresolved (5). Be-cause the accepted names among those resolved is 38\%, it seems reasonable to predict that the same proportion of unresolved names will even-tually be accepted. This yields another \$$\backslash$sim\$100,000 species for a total estimate of 400,000 species (5). Models predict 15\% more to be discovered (6), so the total number of species of land plants should be $>$450,000 species, many more than are con-ventionally assumed to exist. For animals, recent overviews attest to the ques-tion's difficulty. About 1.9 million species are de-scribed (7); the great majority are not. Costello et al. (8) estimate 5 T 3 million species, Mora et al. (9) 8.7 T 1.3 million, and Chapman (7) 11 million. Raven and Yeates (10) estimate 5 to 6 million species of insects alone, whereas Scheffers et al. (11) think uncertainties in insect and fungi num-bers make a plausible range impossible. Estimates for marine species include 2.2 T 0.18 million (9), and Appeltans et al. estimate 0.7 to 1.0 million spe-cies, with 226,000 described and another 70,000 in collections awaiting description (12). Concerns about biodiversity arise because present extinction rates are exceptionally high. Consequently, we first compare current extinc-tion rates to those before human actions elevated them. Vulnerable species are geographically con-centrated, so we next consider the biogeography of species extinction. Given taxonomic incomplete-ness, we consider how undescribed species differ from described species in their geographical range sizes, distributions, and risks of extinction. To understand whether species extinction rates will increase or decrease, we review how and where threats are expanding and whether greater pro-tection may counter them. We conclude by re-viewing prospects for progress in understanding the key lacunae in current knowledge.},

Electrophoretic data from marine organisms are routinely tested for conformity to expectations of the Hardy-Weinberg rule, but the statistical procedures used and the interpretation of their results are often flawed. This paper summarizes literature on statistical testing for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and suggests an analytical strategy based on carrying out computationally simple goodness-of-fit Z a tests (with pooling and correction fac-tors for continuity if necessary) when appropriate, and resorting to computationally tedious, exact tests when necessary. It recommends adjustments of significance levels to avoid the large Type-I error that may result from multiple tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, one for each locus and each population. It points out the obvious but common error of interpreting non-significant tests as evidence of conformity to Hardy-Weinberg expectations, and makes suggestions as to how tests that produce sig-nificance can be used to reach conclusions of biological relevance.},

In Ae. aegypti and other arthropod disease vectors, genetic markers can be used to inform us about processes relevant to disease spread, such as movement of the vectors across space and the temporal stability of vector populations. In late 2009, 27 locally acquired cases of dengue fever were reported in Key West, FL. The last dengue outbreak in the region occurred in 1934. In this study, we used 12 microsatellite loci to examine the genetic structure of 10 Ae. aegypti populations from throughout the Florida Keys and Miami to assess gene flow along the region's main roadway, the Overseas Highway. We also assessed temporal genetic stability of populations in Key West to determine whether the recent outbreak could have been the result of a new introduction of mosquitoes. Though a small amount of geographic genetic structure was detected, our results showed high overall genetic similarity among Ae. aegypti populations sampled in southeastern Florida. No temporal genetic signal was detected in Key West populations collected before and after the outbreak. Consequently, there is potential for dengue transmission across southeastern Florida; renewed mosquito control and surveillance measures should be taken.},

Parnitha - Greece, were estimated using needle morphological traits and gene markers. We tested the connection of morphological variability patterns of light and shade needles with possible adaptation strategies and genetic diversity. Six morphological characteristics were used for the description of both light and shade needles at 100 trees, describing needle size and shape, stomatal density and needle position on the twigs. Additionally, six RAPD and three ISSR markers were applied on DNA from the same trees. Light needles were significantly different than shade needles, in all traits measured, apparently following a different light harvesting strategy. All four subpopulations exhibited high genetic diversity and the differentiation among them was relatively low. Differences among populations in light needles seemed to depend on light exposure and aspect. In shade needles, the four subpopulations seemed to deviate stronger from each other and express a rather geographic pattern, similarly to the genetic markers. Two of the subpopulations studied were lost during a wildfire, two years after sampling. Although the subpopulations burnt were most diverse and most differentiated, we expect a large part of the total genetic diversity of the burnt trees to still exist in the surviving subpopulations, since gene flow must have been effective in keeping all subpopulations connected.},

Examination of the vegetation histories of the three sites during the last interglacial reveals the influence of local climatic conditions with closed mixed forests in the northwest, becoming progressively more open and less diverse farther to the east and south. All three sequences contain a number of similar trends, however, in the expansion of certain taxa. In addition, they also show the presence of a two-step late glacial interval, a short episode of forest reduction in the second part of the interglacial and a final small expansion of tree populations at the very end of the interglacial. Comparison with other European records shows a number of common features, but also suggests differences consistent with the particular environmental setting of the Greek sites.},

  abstract = {The conservation and sustainable use of forests in the twenty-first century pose huge challenges for forest management and policy. Society demands that forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, from timber products, raw materials and renewable energy to sociocultural amenities and habitats for nature conservation. Innovative management and policy approaches need to be developed to meet these often-conflicting demands in a context of environmental change of uncertain magnitude and scale. Genetic diversity is a key component of resilience and adaptability. Overall, forest tree populations are genetically very diverse, conferring them an enormous potential for genetic adaptation via the processes of gene flow and natural selection. Here, we review the main challenges facing our forests in the coming century and focus on how recent progress in genetics can contribute to the development of appropriate practical actions that forest managers and policy makers can adopt to promote forest resilience to climate change. Emerging knowledge will inform and clarify current controversies relating to the choice of appropriate genetic resources for planting, the effect of silvicultural systems and stand tending on adaptive potential and the best ways to harness genetic diversity in breeding and conservation programs. Gaps in our knowledge remain, and we identify where additional information is needed (e.g., the adaptive value of peripheral populations or the genetic determinism of key adaptive traits) and the types of studies that are required to provide this key understanding.},

Rainfall erosivity is most commonly expressed as the R-factor in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revised version, RUSLE. Several studies focus on spatial analysis of rainfall erosivity ignoring the intra-annual variability of this factor. This study assesses rainfall erosivity in Greece on a monthly basis in the form of the RUSLE R-factor, based on a 30-min data from 80 precipitation stations covering an average period of almost 30 years. The spatial interpolation was done through a Generalised Additive Model (GAM). The observed intra-annual variability of rainfall erosivity proved to be high. The warm season is 3 times less erosive than the cold one. November, Decem-ber and October are the most erosive months contrary to July, August and May which are the least erosive. The proportion between rainfall erosivity and precipitation, expressed as erosivity density, varies throughout the year. Erosivity density is low in the first 5 months (January–May) and is relatively high in the remaining 7 months (June–December) of the year. The R-factor maps reveal also a high spatial variability with elevated values in the western Greece and Peloponnesus and very low values in Western Macedonia, Thessaly, Attica and Cyclades. The East–West gradient of rainfall erosivity differs per month with a smoother distribution in summer and a more pronounced gradient during the winter months. The aggregated data for the 12 months result in an average R-factor of 807 MJ mm ha −1 h −1 year −1 with a range from 84 to 2825 MJ mm ha −1 h −1 year −1 . The combination of monthly R-factor maps with vegetation coverage and tillage maps contributes to better monitor soil erosion risk at national level and monthly basis.},

(2015) comment on " Rainfall erosivity in Europe " , 5 criticisms were addressed: i) the neglect of seasonal erosion indices, ii) the neglect of published studies and data, iii) the low temporal res-olution of the data, especially of the maximum rain intensity, iv) the use of precipitation data instead of rain data and the subsequent deviation of the R-factor in Germany and Austria compared with previous studies, and v) the differences in considered time periods between countries. We reply as follows: (i) An evaluation of the seasonal erosion index at the European scale is, to our knowledge, not achievable at pres-ent with the available data but would be a future goal. Synchronous publication of the seasonal erosion index is not mandatory, specifically because seasonal soil loss ratios are not available at this scale to date. We are looking forward to the appropriate study by the authors of the comment, who assert that they have access to the required data. (ii) We discuss and evaluate relevant studies in our original work and in this reply; however, we cannot consider what is not available to the scientific community. (iii) The third point of critique was based on a misunderstanding by Auerswald et al. (2015), as we did indeed calculate the maximum intensity with the highest resolution of data available. (iv) The low R-factor values in Germany and the higher values in Austria compared with previous studies are not due to the involvement of snow but are rather due to a Pan-European interpolation. We argue that an interpola-tion across the borders of Austria creates a more reliable data set.},

Sediment retention receives particular interest given the impact of this service on water quality. We developed a new version of the sediment retention model for the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) tool to address previous limitations and facilitate model uncertainty assessment. We tested the model in the Cape Fear basin, North Carolina (NC), performing sensitivity analyses and assessing its ability to detect the spatial variability in sediment retention service for eight subcatchments. The main advantages of the revised model include the use of spatially-explicit, globally available input data, and the explicit consideration of hydrological connectivity in the landscape. The sensitivity analyses in the study catchment identified the erosivity and erodibility factors, together with the cover factor for agricultural land as the most influential parameter for sediment export. Relative predictions, representing the spatial variability in sediment exports, were correctly represented by the model. Absolute sediment exports were also highly correlated with observations, although their interpretation for socio-economic assessments is more uncertain without local knowledge of the dominant erosion processes. This work confirms that the sediment connectivity approach used in the revised InVEST model has great potential to quantify the sediment retention service. Although resources to conduct model calibration and testing are typ-ically scarce, these practices should be encouraged to improve model interpretation and for confident application in different decision-making contexts. Without calibration, the InVEST sediment model still provides relevant in-formation for ecosystem services assessments, especially in decision contexts that involve ranking of sediment export areas, such as spatial prioritization of conservation, development or restoration activities, taking into account non-linear sediment responses to changes in land use.},

  abstract = {The ecosystem services concept offers an interdisciplinary approach to the integrative study of both socio-economical and ecological systems. The sediment retention service is mentioned among the regulation ecosystem services in all the main international classifications (MA, TEEB, CICES). It refers to the capacity of ecosystems to regulate the quantity of eroded sediment reaching the stream network, and thus delivering benefits like maintaining soil and water quality and reservoir functions. This paper aims to assess the link between possible land cover changes and the sediment retention service provided by the vegetation cover. The analysis focuses on a mountain landscape from the upper catchment of Râul Târgului, Iezer Mountains in the Romanian Carpathians. To this purpose, we considered recent changes in the forest landscape (2005-2012) and, with the participation of local administrative stakeholders, we developed three land cover scenarios (Business-as-Usual, Conservation and Development). For each simulated land cover map we compared the supply of sediment retention services by using quantitative indicators: sediment retention, sediment export and the amount of potential soil loss. For the processing of spatial data we applied GIS techniques using the ArcGIS software (ESRI) and for the modeling we used the InVEST 3.2 software (Natural Capital Project). One of our major findings is that the landscape of 2012 retained approximately 3 million tons/year of sediment. Further on, our results show the highest decrease in the sediment retention service for the Development scenario and the highest increase for the Conservation scenario. However, these changes represent less than 2\% of the 2012 values. Overall, our results show that the tools and models used proved to deliver credible and relevant results and can be used for future local landscape planning.},

Key limitations of simple models arise at very small scales, and in predicting specific future BES values; (3) training local experts in the approaches and tools is important for building local capacity, ownership, trust, and long-term success; (4) decision makers and stake-holders prefer to use a variety of BES value metrics, not only monetary values; (5) an important science gap exists in linking changes in BES to changes in livelihoods, health, cultural values, and other metrics of human wellbeing; and (6) communicating uncertainty in useful and transparent ways remains challenging.},

  abstract = {Considering that the pyramidal fir is of high conservation importance for Serbia forest diversity, the aim of this study was to determine, using SSR marker analysis, spatial genetic profile of the endemic and marginalised Abies alba population from Ogorijevac, Serbia. Leaf samples from nineteen Abies alba individuals from Ogorijevac site were collected, where nine of them were determined by morphological traits as Abies alba fPyramidalisánd ten as a typical, silver fir, (Abies alba Mill.). PCR amplification was done with the 19 SSR primers in three multiplex mixes (16 EST-SSRs divided in 2 multiplexes and three genomic SSRs as a separate multiplex mix). Successful amplification was obtained for 17 out of 19 markers. Fragment analysis of PCR products was done on capillary electrophoresis automatic sequencer where, afterwards, scoring of resulted peaks was obtained using the GeneMarker V2.4.0 and MicroChecker software. Spatial genetic profile analysis was evaluated via BAPS software. The results of spatial BAPS showed the presence of two clusters (7/12) among 19 sampled individuals, indicating significant difference in genetic profile between selected silver fir (taxa) samples. Cluster differentiation within marginalised population of silver fir showed the results of such genetic profile which will be used as a platform for further molecular genetic research and conservation strategies of this endemic species. This research was done on STSM project within COST Action FP 1202 (MaP-FGR). Introduction Silver fir is an ecologically valuable and indigenous tree species in many European mountain forests. It occupies a wide variety of ecological sites ranging from the East Carpathians to the Pyrenees and from the Beskides in Poland to the mountains of northern Greece (Larsen 1986). In the course of several episodes of silver fir decline during the past century, its populations have decreased in size and number and currently are scattered throughout the entire European range (Konnert and Bergmann 1995). Although silver fir in the Western Balkans area very rarely forms pure stands, it is the most important constituent element of mixed forests of fir and beech (Abieti-Fagetum s.l.) (Ballian et al. 2012). Its significance, but also its threatened status and decline caused by atmospheric and soil pollution, especially in the Slovenian Dinaric Alps, in Gorski Kotar (Croatia) and western Bosnia (Tikvić et al. 1995, Seletković and Tikvić 1996, Ušćuplić et al. 2007) has made it the subject of numerous studies (Ballian et al. 2012). The first scientific observation and probably the first written record of the site with the excessively narrow habitus of silver fir in Ogorijevac were done by Tošić (1963). From the mid-nineteenth century, when the first case of the pyramidal variety of the Abies alba Mill. was described, only few individual specimens of this variety, whose habitus has a pyramidal shape, survived until today. Discovery of the population of this extremely rare variety of silver fir attracted the attention of scientists and the general public, followed by a several authors who have studied and described in details mainly morphometric characteristics of the variety (Tošić},

Contrastingly, the southern population (Guara) shows climatic variables close to western sites but without defoliation and with a higher genetic diversity, indicating a possible adaptation to the sub-Mediter-ranean conditions.

(Silver fir) and the Greek endemic A. cephalonica Loud (Greek fir). Even though A. 9 borisii-regis has attracted much research attention in the past, its origin, geographical dis-tribution and taxonomic status are not fully elucidated and molecular evidence for hybridization is missing. To shed more light on this issue, we analyzed representative pop-ulations from these three Abies taxa using paternally inherited (chloroplast) and maternally inherited (mito-chondrial) DNA markers. Both Silver and Greek fir could be clearly distinguished using mitochondrial markers, while we observed a mixture of maternal lineages in the A. 9 borisii-regis populations. In contrast, using chloro-plast markers, we could not identify species-specific hap-lotypes, but a neighbor-joining analysis of population genetic distances revealed two separate clusters for the Silver fir and the Greek fir, while the A. 9 borisii-regis populations were placed in intermediate positions. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the A. 9 borisii-regis populations investigated are a result of hybridization between A. cephalonica and A. alba.},

We found eight and 18 different length variants at each locus, respectively, which combined into 90 different haplotypes. Genetic distances between most populations were high and significant. There is also evidence for spatial organization of the distribution of haplotypes, as shown by permutation tests, which demonstrate that genetic distances increase with spatial distances. A large heterogeneity in levels of diversity across populations was observed. Furthermore, there is good congruence in the levels of allelic richness of the two loci across populations. The present organization of levels of allelic richness across the range of the species is likely to have been shaped by the dis- tribution of refugia during the last glaciation and the subsequent recolonization processes.},

  abstract = {Allelic richness (number of alleles) is a measure of genetic diversity indicative of a population's long-term potential for adaptability and persistence. It is used less commonly than heterozygosity as a genetic diversity measure, partially because it is more mathematically difficult to take into account the stochastic process of genetic drift for allelic richness. This paper presents a stochastic model for the allelic richness of a newly founded population experiencing genetic drift and gene flow. The model follows the dynamics of alleles lost during the founder event and simulates the effect of gene flow on maintenance and recovery of allelic richness. The probability of an allele's presence in the population was identified as the relevant statistical property for a meaningful interpretation of allelic richness. A method is discussed that combines the probability of allele presence with a population's allele frequency spectrum to provide predictions for allele recovery. The model's analysis provides insights into the dynamics of allelic richness following a founder event, taking into account gene flow and the allele frequency spectrum. Furthermore, the model indicates that the "One Migrant per Generation" rule, a commonly used conservation guideline related to heterozygosity, may be inadequate for addressing preservation of diversity at the allelic level. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between heterozygosity and allelic richness as measures of genetic diversity, since focusing merely on the preservation of heterozygosity might not be enough to adequately preserve allelic richness, which is crucial for species persistence and evolution.},

  title = {{{DNA Fountain}} Enables a Robust and Efficient Storage Architecture},
  abstract = {DNA is an attractive medium to store digital information. Here we report a storage strategy, called DNA Fountain, that is highly robust and approaches the information capacity per nucleotide. Using our approach, we stored a full computer operating system, movie, and other files with a total of 2.14 × 10 6 bytes in DNA oligonucleotides and perfectly retrieved the information from a sequencing coverage equivalent to a single tile of Illumina sequencing. We also tested a process that can allow 2.18 × 10 15 retrievals using the original DNA sample and were able to perfectly decode the data. Finally, we explored the limit of our architecture in terms of bytes per molecule and obtained a perfect retrieval from a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA, orders of magnitude higher than previous reports. H umanity is currently producing data at exponential rates, creating a demand for better storage devices. DNA is an excellent medium for data storage, owing to its dem-onstrated information density of petabytes of data per gram, high durability, and evolution-arily optimized machinery to faithfully replicate this information (1, 2). Recently, a series of proof-of-principle experiments has demonstrated the value of DNA as a storage medium (3–9). To better understand its potential, we explored the Shannon information capacity (10, 11) of DNA storage (12). This measure sets a tight upper bound on the amount of information that can be reliably stored in each nucleotide. In an ideal world, the information capacity of each nucleo-tide could reach 2 bits, as there are four possible options. However, DNA encoding faces several practical limitations. First, not all DNA sequences are created equal (13, 14). Biochemical constraints dictate that DNA sequences with high GC con-tent or long homopolymer runs (e.g., AAAAAA$\backslash$ldots) are undesirable, as they are difficult to synthe-size and prone to sequencing errors. Second, oligonucleotide (hereafter " oligo ") synthesis, poly-merase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and decay of DNA during storage can induce uneven representation of the oligos (7, 15). This might result in dropout of a small fraction of oligos that will not be available for decoding. In addition to biochemical constraints, oligos are sequenced in a pool and necessitate indexing to infer their order, which further limits the number of avail-able nucleotides for encoding information.},

  doi = {10.3389/fgene.2016.00198},
  abstract = {The recent introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies represents a major revolution in providing new tools for identifying the genes and/or genomic intervals controlling important traits for selection in breeding programs. In perennial fruit trees with long generation times and large sizes of adult plants, the impact of these techniques is even more important. Highthroughput DNA sequencing technologies have provided complete annotated sequences in many important tree species. Most of the highthroughput genotyping platforms described are being used for studies of genetic diversity and population structure. Dissection of complex traits became possible through the availability of genome sequences along with phenotypic variation data, which allow to elucidate the causative genetic differences that give rise to observed phenotypic variation. Association mapping facilitates the association between genetic markers and phenotype in unstructured and complex populations, identifying molecular markers for assisted selection and breeding. Also, genomic data provide in silico identification and characterization of genes and gene families related to important traits, enabling new tools for molecular marker assisted selection in tree breeding. Deep sequencing of transcriptomes is also a powerful tool for the analysis of precise expression levels of each gene in a sample. It consists in quantifying short cDNA reads, obtained by NGS technologies, in order to compare the entire transcriptomes between genotypes and environmental conditions. The miRNAs are noncoding short RNAs involved in the regulation of different physiological processes, which can be identified by highthroughput sequencing of RNA libraries obtained by reverse transcription of purified short RNAs, and by in silico comparison with known miRNAs from other species. All together, NGS techniques and their applications have increased the resources for plant breeding in tree species, closing the former gap of genetic tools between trees and annual species.},

  abstract = {Tree planting is widely advocated and applied in urban areas, with large-scale projects underway in cities globally. Numerous potential benefits are used to justify these planting campaigns. However, reports of poor tree survival raise questions about the ability of such projects to deliver on their promises over the long-term. Each potential benefit requires different supporting conditions—relating not only to the type and placement of the tree, but also to the broader urban system within which it is embedded. This set of supporting conditions may not always be mutually compatible and may not persist for the lifetime of the tree. Here, we demonstrate a systems-based approach that makes these dependencies, synergies, and tensions more explicit, allowing them to be used to test the decadal-scale resilience of urban street trees. Our analysis highlights social, environmental, and economic assumptions that are implicit within planting projects; notably that high levels of maintenance and public support for urban street trees will persist throughout their natural lifespan, and that the surrounding built form will remain largely unchanged. Whilst the vulnerability of each benefit may be highly context specific, we identify approaches that address some typical weaknesses, making a functional, resilient, urban forest more attainable.},

PCR amplification of these regions using a single primer yields multiple amplification products that can be used as a dominant multilocus marker system for the study of genetic variation in various organisms. ISSR markers are easy to use, low-cost, and methodologically less demanding compared to other dominant markers, making it an ideal genetic marker for beginners and for organisms whose genetic information is lacking. Here, we comment upon some of the intricacies often overlooked in designing an ISSR experiment, clarify some misconceptions, and provide recommendations on using ISSR markers in genetic variation studies.},

  abstract = {Safeguarding sustainability of forest ecosystems with their habitat variability and all their functions is of highest priority. Therefore, the longterm adaptability of forest ecosystems to a changing environment must be secured, e.g., through sustainable forest management. High adaptability is based on biological variation starting at the genetic level. Thus, the ultimate goal of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to halt the ongoing erosion of biological variation is of utmost importance for forest ecosystem functioning and sustainability. Monitoring of biological diversity over time is needed to detect changes that threaten these biological resources. Genetic variation, as an integral part of biological diversity, needs special attention, and its monitoring can ensure its effective conservation. We compare forest genetic monitoring to other biodiversity monitoring concepts. Forest genetic monitoring (FGM) enables early detection of potentially harmful changes of forest adaptability before these appear at higher biodiversity levels (e.g., species or ecosystem diversity) and can improve the sustainability of applied forest management practices and direct further research. Theoretical genetic monitoring concepts developed up to now need to be evaluated before being implemented on a national and international scale. This article provides an overview of FGM concepts and definitions, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and provides a flow chart of the steps needed for the optimization and implementation of FGM. FGM is an important module of biodiversity monitoring, and we define an effective FGM scheme as consisting of an assessment of a forest population's capacity to survive, reproduce, and persist under rapid environmental changes on a longterm scale.},

Previous studies have used DNA barcoding to inventory species for applications in biodiversity monitoring, conservation impact assessment, monitoring of illegal trading, authentication of traded medicinal plants etc. This is the first tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF) barcode study in the World and the first attempt to assemble a reference barcode library for the trees of India as part of a larger project initiated by this research group. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sampled 429 trees representing 143 tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF) species, which included 16 threatened species. DNA barcoding was completed using rbcL and matK markers. The tiered approach (1st tier rbcL; 2nd tier matK) correctly identified 136 out of 143 species (95\%). This high level of species resolution was largely due to the fact that the tree species were taxonomically diverse in the TDEF. Ability to resolve taxonomically diverse tree species of TDEF was comparable among the best match method, the phylogenetic method, and the characteristic attribute organization system method. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the utility of the TDEF reference barcode library to authenticate wood samples from timber operations in the TDEF. This pilot research study will enable more comprehensive surveys of the illegal timber trade of threatened species in the TDEF. This TDEF reference barcode library also contains trees that have medicinal properties, which could be used to monitor unsustainable and indiscriminate collection of plants from the wild for their medicinal value.},

Three mitochondrial lineages were observed, one comprising Calabrian populations and two distributed in the Balkans, coinciding with A. alba and A. cephalonica. The boundary between lineages is sharp; only two populations containing a mixture of haplotypes were found. Bayesian analysis of population structure based on seven nuclear microsatellite (nSSR) loci revealed the existence of two clusters whose proportions exhibited a latitudinal cline with a width of 2.3° ( ≈ 255 km).

Methods and Results: A normalized cDNA library was built from an A. alba seedling. The sequencing on a 454 platform yielded more than 1.5 million reads that were de novo assembled into 25 149 contigs. Two complementary approaches were applied to annotate gene fragments that code for (1) well-known proteins and (2) proteins that are potentially adaptively relevant. Primer development and testing yielded 88 amplicons that could successfully be resequenced from genomic DNA. Conclusions: The annotation workflow offers an efficient way to identify potential adaptively relevant genes from the large quantity of transcriptome sequence data. The primer set presented should be prioritized for single-nucleotide polymorphism detection in adaptively relevant genes in A. alba.},

With limited information about the extent and scale of adaptive variation in native trees, discussion about suitable seed sources often emphasises “local” in a very narrow sense or within political boundaries, rather than being based on sound evidence of the scale over which adaptation occurs. Concerns exist over the actual scale (magnitude and spatial scale) of adaptation in trees and the relative dangers of incorrect seed source or restricted seed collection, leading to the establishment of trees with restricted genetic diversity and limited adaptive potential. Tree provenance and progeny field trials in many parts of the world have shown the existence of genotype by environment interaction in many tree species, but have not necessarily looked at whether this is expressed as a home site advantage (i.e. whether provenance performance is unstable across sites, and there is better performance of a local seed source).},

  abstract = {Genetic analysis was carried out in order to provide insights into differentiation among populations of two interfertile oak species, Quercus petraea and Quercus robur. Gene flow between the two species, local adaptation and speciation processes in general, may leave differential molecular signatures across the genome. Three interspecific pairs of natural populations from three ecologically different regions, one in central Europe (SW Germany) and two in the Balkan Peninsula (Greece and Bulgaria) were sampled. Grouping of highly informative SSR loci was made according to the component of variation they express-interspecific or provenance specific. 'Species' and 'provenance discriminant' loci were characterized based on FSTs. Locus specific FSTs were tested for deviation from the neutral expectation both within and between species. Data were then treated separately in a Bayesian analysis of genetic structure. By using three 'species discriminant' loci, high membership probability to inferred species groups was achieved. On the other hand, analysis of genetic structure based on five 'provenance discriminant' loci was correlated with geographic region and revealed shared genetic variation between neighbouring Q. petraea and Q. robur. Small sets of highly variable nuclear SSRs were sufficient to discriminate, either between species or between provenances. Thus, an effective tool is provided for molecular identification of both species and provenances. Furthermore, data suggest that a combination of gene flow and natural selection forms these diversity patterns. 'Species discriminant' loci might represent genome regions affected by directional selection, which maintains species identity. 'Provenance specific' loci might represent genome regions with high interspecific gene flow and common adaptive patterns to local environmental factors. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The study included Finnish Scots pine populations (from latitude 60°N to 70°N) which experience a steep climatic gradient. Common garden experiments show that these populations are adapted to the location of their origin and genetically differentiated in adaptive quantitative traits, e.g. the date of bud set in first-year seedlings. In the northernmost population, bud set took place about 21 days earlier than in the southernmost population. Of the total variation in bud set, 36.4\% was found among the populations. All molecular markers showed high levels of within-population variation, while differentiation among populations was low. Among all the studied markers, microsatellites were the most variable (He=0.77). Differences between populations were small, GST was less than 0.02. Our study suggests that molecular markers may be poor predictors of the population differentiation of quantitative traits in Scots pine, as exemplified here by bud-set date.},

Population genomics are discussed considering the still elusive elucidation of quantitative and adaptive variation at the molecular level. This chapter focuses on the use of genome-wide sampling to discern evolutionary processes and the spatially explicit patterns of genomic variation. The transition from conservation genetics to conservation genomics will increase manifold our ability to select and prioritize conservation targets. Conservation genomics will lead to the identification of particular genomic regions that. may have undergone natural selection and are of adaptive significance, in addition to improving the precision of genetic and demographic inferences by significantly raising the number of putatively neutral markers assayed.

For example, if the number of generations required for a gene substitution is 1000generations and the number of gene substitutions per generation is 1, as was estimated from molecular data (cf. Kimura, 1973), then there will be 1000 loci at which gene substitution is proceeding. If there are two alleles at each locus, the possible number of genotypes for these 1000 loci is 2100 z 1 0 \$$\backslash$sim\$ \$$\backslash$sim\$This '. number is so enormous, that only a small proportion of the possible geno- types will actually appear in the population. Particularly, those genotypes which have a large number of advantageous (or disadvantageous) genes would never appear in practice. In other words, the largest number of advantageous alleles that can be possessed by an individual in a finite population must be much smaller than the maximum possible number. The fertility excess required would then be much lower than that in infinite populations, if population size is controlled by outside factors and selection is competitive. For example, Kimura and Ohta (1971 b) show that if popula- tion size is lo5, selection coefficients (s) are 0.01, and the number of gene substitutions per generation is 1, the individual carrying the largest number of advantageous alleles must have about 1.58 times as many offspring as the average individual in a haploid population. The equivalent value for a diploid population is 1.92. This requirement is much smaller than the fertility excess required in infinite populations. However, there seems to be a problem in the computation by Kimura, Ohta, and Ewens. They compute the mean fitness of the most fit individual in a finite population after deriving the variance of fitness using the model of unlimited fertility. T the model of limited fertility is used from the beginning, f the rate of change of gene frequency is reduced (Nei, 1973b). Apparently, a more careful study should be made of the fertility excess required in a finite population. The actual fertility excess required seems to be higher than that obtained by Kimura and Ohta. The theory of cost of natural selection strongly influenced Kimura (1968a) in his development of the neutral mutation hypothesis. Using the data on Go to CONTENTS Natural selection and its eflects 66 amino acid sequences of hemoglobin, cytochrome c, etc. in diverse organisms, he computed the rate of nucleotide substitution per DNA base per year as 10-lo. Since the mammalian genome has some 3.2 x 10' base pairs, this corresponds to a rate of gene (base) substitution equal to about 0.5 per year per genome. He thought that this rate is so high compared with Haldane's computation, i.e., 11300 = 0.003 per generation, that all of the gene sub- stitutions cannot be due to natural selection. In order to explain the dis- crepancy, Kimura suggested that a majority of gene substitutions have occurred by random fixation of neutral or nearly neutral mutations. As will be discussed in the next chapter, if the product of population size and selection coefficient is much smaller than 1, the gene frequency change is dictated by random genetic drift and no fertility excess is required. As mentioned above, however, the fertility excess required for gene sub- stitution in finite populations seems to be smaller than Haldane and Kimura originally thought, though this problem is not completely settled. Further- more, as will be discussed later, a large part of the DNA of higher organisms seems to be nonfunctional. Therefore, Kimura's original argument is less compelling at the present time. Nevertheless, his neutral mutation hypothesis may be correct, and, in fact, there is evidence to support this hypothesis (ch. 8).},

  abstract = {Molecular markers appear to be poor indicators of heritable variation in adaptive traits. Direct comparison of population structure in markers with that in traits is made possible by the measure Qst, which partitions quantitative genetic variation in a manner analogous to Fst for single gene markers. A survey of the literature reveals that mean Qst is typically larger than and poorly correlated with mean Fst across 29 species. Within species, Qst varies widely among traits; traits experiencing the strongest local selection pressures are expected to be the most divergent from molecular Fst. Thus, Qst will be particularly relevant to conservation efforts where preserving extant adaptation to local environments is an important goal. Recent theoretical and simulation studies suggest however that Fst is a better predictor of the pattern of allelic differentiation at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) than is Qst in random mating populations, in which case allelic variation at QTLs might be better assessed by molecular markers than will extant variation in the traits themselves.},

Increasingly, forest scientists are finding genetic/genomic resources valuable in addressing forest health issues. For a set of ten ecologically and economically important native hardwood tree species representing a broad phylogenetic spectrum, we used low coverage whole genome sequencing from multiplex Illumina paired ends to economically profile their genomic content. For six species, the genome content was further analyzed by flow cytometry in order to determine the nuclear genome size. Sequencing yielded a depth of 0.8X to 7.5X, from which in silico analysis yielded preliminary estimates of gene and repetitive sequence content in the genome for each species. Thousands of genomic SSRs were identified, with a clear predisposition toward dinucleotide repeats and AT-rich repeat motifs. Flanking primers were designed for SSR loci for all ten species, ranging from 891 loci in sugar maple to 18,167 in redbay. In summary, we have demonstrated that useful preliminary genome information including repeat content, gene content and useful SSR markers can be obtained at low cost and time input from a single lane of Illumina multiplex sequence.},

Over the last few years, epigenetic research has undergone a gradual shift and recent studies have been directed toward a genome-wide assessment. DNA methylation and chromatin modifications are essential components of the regulation of gene activity. DNA methylation effectively down-regulates gene activity by addition of a methyl group to the five-carbon of a cytosine base. Less specifically, modification of the chromatin structure can be carried out by multiple mechanisms leading to either the upregulation or down-regulation of the associated gene. Of the many assays used to assess the effects of epigenetic modifications, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which serves to monitor changes in chromatin structure, and bisulfite modification, which tracks changes in DNA methylation, are the two most commonly used techniques.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an important, heritable epigenetic modification in most eukaryotic organisms that is connected with numerous biological processes. To study the impact of natural epigenetic variation in an ecological or evolutionary context, epigenetic studies are increasingly using methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) for surveys at the population or species level. However, no consensus exists on how to interpret and score the multistate information obtained from the MSAP banding patterns. Here, we review the previously used scoring approaches for population epigenetic studies and develop new alternatives. To assess effects of the different approaches on parameters of epigenetic diversity and differentiation, we applied eight scoring schemes to a case study of three populations of the plant species Viola elatior. For a total number of 168 detected polymorphic MSAP fragments, the number of ultimately scored polymorphic epiloci ranged between 78 and 286 depending on the particular scoring scheme. Both, estimates of epigenetic diversity and differentiation varied strongly between scoring approaches. However, linear regression and PCoA revealed qualitatively similar patterns, suggesting that the scoring approaches are largely consistent. For single-locus analyses of MSAP data, for example the search for loci under selection, we advocate a new scoring approach that separately takes into account different methylation types and thus seems appropriate for drawing more detailed conclusions in ecological or evolutionary contexts. An R script (MSAP\_score.r) for scoring and basic data analysis is provided.},

We therefore investigated the utility of a pre-wash step using a buffered sorbitol solution, prior to DNA extraction using a high salt CTAB extraction protocol, in a high throughput or miniprep setting. This pre-wash appears to remove interfering metabolites, such as polyphenols and polysaccharides, from tissue macerates. We also investigated the adaptability of the sorbitol pre-wash for RNA extraction using a lithium chloride-based protocol. The method was successfully applied to a variety of tissues, including leaf, cambium and fruit of diverse plant species including annual crops, forest and fruit trees, herbarium leaf material and lyophilized fungal mycelium. We consistently obtained good yields of high purity DNA or RNA in all species tested. The protocol has been validated for thousands of DNA samples by generating high data quality in dense SNP arrays. DNA extracted from Eucalyptus spp. leaf and cambium as well as mycelium from Trichoderma spp. was readily digested with restriction enzymes and performed consistently in AFLP assays. Scaled-up DNA extractions were also suitable for long read sequencing. Successful RNA quality control and good RNA-Seq data for Eucalyptus and cashew confirms the effectiveness of the sorbitol buffer pre-wash for high quality RNA extraction.},

  abstract = {Understanding local adaptation in forest trees is currently a key research and societal priority. Geographically and ecologically marginal populations provide ideal case studies, because environmental stress along with reduced gene flow can facilitate the establishment of locally adapted populations. We sampled European silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) trees in the French Mediterranean Alps, along the margin of its distribution range, from pairs of high- and low-elevation plots on four different mountains situated along a 170-km east–west transect. The analysis of 267 SNP loci from 175 candidate genes suggested a neutral pattern of east–west isolation by distance among mountain sites. FST outlier tests revealed 16 SNPs that showed patterns of divergent selection. Plot climate was characterized using both in situ measurements and gridded data that revealed marked differences between and within mountains with different trends depending on the season. Association between allelic frequencies and bioclimatic variables revealed eight genes that contained candidate SNPs, of which two were also detected using FST outlier methods. All SNPs were associated with winter drought, and one of them showed strong evidence of selection with respect to elevation. QST–FST tests for fitness-related traits measured in a common garden suggested adaptive divergence for the date of bud flush and for growth rate. Overall, our results suggest a complex adaptive picture for A. alba in the southern French Alps where, during the east-to-west Holocene recolonization, locally advantageous genetic variants established at both the landscape and local scales.},

  abstract = {Forest tree breeding has been successful at delivering genetically improved material for multiple traits based on recurrent cycles of selection, mating and testing. However, long breeding cycles, late flowering, variable juvenile-mature correlations, emerging pests and diseases, climate and market changes, all pose formidable challenges. Genetic dissection approaches such as quantitative trait mapping and association genetics have been fruitless to effectively drive operational marker-assisted selection in forest trees, largely because of the complex multifactorial inheritance of most, if not all traits of interest. The convergence of high-throughput genomics and quantitative genetics has established two new paradigms that are changing contemporary tree breeding dogmas. Genomic selection (GS) uses large number of genome-wide markers to predict complex phenotypes. It has the potential to accelerate breeding cycles, increase selection intensity and improve the accuracy of breeding values. Realized genomic relationships matrices, on the other hand, provide innovations in genetic parameters’ estimation and breeding approaches by tracking the variation arising from random Mendelian segregation in pedigrees. In light of a recent flow of promising experimental results, here we briefly review the main concepts, analytical tools and remaining challenges that currently underlie the application of genomics data to tree breeding. With easy and cost-effective genotyping, we are now at the brink of extensive adoption of GS in tree breeding. Areas for future GS research include optimizing strategies for updating prediction models, adding validated functional genomics data to improve prediction accuracy, and integrating genomic and multi-environment data for forecasting the performance of genetic material in untested sites or under changing climate scenarios. The buildup of phenotypic and genome-wide data across large-scale breeding populations and advances in computational prediction of discrete genomic features should also provide opportunities to enhance the application of genomics to tree breeding.},

  abstract = {This paper is an overview of the diverse, predominantly molecular techniques, used in assessing plant genetic diversity. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the application of molecular genetic methods for assessing the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. Molecular techniques have been applied in the analysis of specific genes, as well as to increase understanding of gene action, generate genetic maps and assist in the development of gene transfer technologies. Molecular techniques have also had critical roles in studies of phylogeny and species evolution, and have been applied to increase our understanding of the distribution and extent of genetic variation within and between species. These techniques are well established and their advantages as well as limitations have been realized and described in this work. Recently, a new class of advanced techniques has emerged, primarily derived from a combination of earlier, more basic techniques. Advanced marker techniques tend to amalgamate advantageous features of several basic techniques, in order to increase the sensitivity and resolution to detect genetic discontinuity and distinctiveness. Some of the advanced marker techniques utilize newer classes of DNA elements, such as retrotransposons, mitochondrial and chloroplast based microsatellites, thereby revealing genetic variation through increased genome coverage. Techniques such as RAPD and AFLP are also being applied to cDNA-based templates to study patterns of gene expression and uncover the genetic basis of biological responses. The most important and recent advances made in molecular marker techniques are discussed in this review, along with their applications, advantages and limitations applied to plant sciences.},

Different types of molecular markers have been developed and advancement in sequencing technologies has geared crop improvement.

This review is intended to be a synopsis of recent developments in molecular markers and their applications in plant breeding and is devoted to early researchers with a little or no knowledge of molecular markers. The progress made in molecular plant breeding, genetics, genomic selection and genome editing has contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of molecular markers and provided deeper insights into the diversity available for crops and greatly complemented breeding stratagems. Genotyping-by-sequencing and association mapping based on next-generation sequencing technologies have facilitated the identiﬁcation of novel genetic markers for complex and unstructured populations.

This is the first report of such phenotypic changes after intra-species/inter-cultivar grafting in Cucurbitaceae. Additionally, we found significant changes in (i) secondary metabolite profile, (ii) global DNA methylation pattern and (iii) miRNA expression patterns in grafted scions and (iv) DNA methylation on graft-induced phenotypic changes in grafted plants. Our results contribute to further understanding graft-induced effects on fruit morphology in intra-species grafting.

  abstract = {Trees are a charismatic group of plants bound together by life form rather than taxonomy, as the tree form occurs across most phylogenetic lineages of plants. Trees resist a rigorous definition but can broadly be defined as having secondary thickening (wood), large stature, and great longevity. This article focuses on angiosperms and addresses salient issues in the evolution of trees and highlights the current conservation practices. Although the tree form has arisen on multiple instances, evidence suggests a common origin of the woody habit. Parallel evolution and reversals in woody traits have obscured this origin; however, recent molecular evidence suggests a common origin of lignocellulosic genes involved in the production of wood. Trees tend to have high levels of heterozygosity, nevertheless a consensus has not been reached on the evolutionary potential of trees to withstand climate change and a more thorough understanding of phenotypic plasticity is essential to predict their response to short- and medium-term climate change. Approximately 1\% of global tree species have been genetically characterised to some extent. Direct measurement or use of indicators and proxies is needed to get a more comprehensive indication of global forest genetic resources. As large, long-lived organisms, a dynamic or close-to-nature in situ conservation approach, which facilitates evolution, is the most efficient option and best practice for tree conservation.},

This paper reviews the literature on the activity of vertebrate (principally avian) olive predators and their potential as vectors for spreading this plant into Australian remnant bushland. The effects of feralisation on the olive plant, which enhances its capacity for dispersal as a weed, place wider areas of south-eastern Australia at risk. A number of approaches for the control of olives as woody weeds are addressed.

Patterns of diversity of the wild form inferred eleven ancestral populations in the East and the West of the Mediterranean basin. Patterns of diversity for cultivars are less clear, but we showed that cultivars admixed to nine groups that corresponded to oleaster ancestral populations. We inferred that nine domestication events took place in the olive, but these origins were blurred by gene flow from oleaster and by human displacements. These origins of domestication probably reflected different reasons and uses to domesticate the oleaster. To cite this article: C. Breton et al., C. R. Biologies 332 (2009).

La diversité actuelle de l'olivier (cultivé) et de l'oléastre (sauvage) a été étudiée avec des marqueurs nucléaires et cytoplasmiques. Les patrons de diversité de la forme sauvage conduisent onze populations ancestrales à l'Est et l'Ouest du bassin méditerranéen. Pour les cultivars, les patrons de diversité sont moins tranchés, mais nous avons montré qu'ils se rattachent à neuf groupes qui correspondent à neuf des onze populations ancestrales d'oléastre. Nous en avons déduit que neuf évènements de domestication différents se sont produits pour conduire à l'olivier actuel, mais les origines sont rendues diffuses du fait de flux de gènes avec l'oléastre et des déplacements des cultivars par l'homme. Ces origines de domestication reflètent probablement diverses motivations et utilisations de l'olivier et de ses produits. Pour citer cet article : C. Breton et al., C. R. Biologies 332 (2009).},

  abstract = {Genetic structure and evolutionary patterns of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea L.) were investigated with AFLP fingerprinting data at three geographic levels: (a) phylogenetic relationships of the six currently recognized subspecies in Eurasia and Africa; (b) lineage identification in subsp. europaea of the Mediterranean basin; and (c) phylogeography in the western Mediterranean. Two statistical approaches (Bayesian inference and analysis of molecular variance) were used to analyse the AFLP fingerprints. To determine the congruency and transferability of results across studies previous RAPD and ISSR data were analysed in a similar manner. Comparisons proved that qualitative results were mostly congruent but quantitative values differed, depending on the method of analysis. Neighbour-Joining analysis of AFLP phenotypes supported current classification of subspecies. At a Mediterranean scale no clear cut phylogeographic pattern was recovered, likely due to extensive gene flow between populations of subsp. europaea. Gene flow estimates calculated with conventional F-statistics showed that reproductive barriers separated neither populations nor lineages of O. europaea. Genetic divergence between eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean basin was observed only when geographical and population information were incorporated into the analyses through hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Within the western Mediterranean, the highest genetic diversity was found in two regions: on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar and in the Balearic archipelago. Additionally, long-lasting isolation of the northern-most populations of the Iberian Peninsula appeared to be responsible for a significant divergence.},

Wild (21 individuals) and cultivated olive trees (22 local cultivars from a germplasm collection and 35 ancient trees) were genotyped by means of 13 SSR loci. Five cases of synonymy were observed and nine distinct genotypes were identified in the collection. Five novel genotypes were also detected among the ancient trees. Differences on the allelic composition and heterozygosity levels were found between wild and cultivated trees. Model-based clustering method classified the olive trees into two major gene pools: (a) wild genotypes and (b) local cultivars from the collection and from heritage olives. Regarding the cultivated plant material, we observed that: (a) most of the Sardinian cultivars shared the same allelic profiles with the ancient cultivated trees and (b) the majority of these cultivars and all the novel genotypes were not related to any other cultivars included in this study. These findings as well as the detection of unique alleles and a certain wild genetic background at some cultivars revealed by the Bayesian analysis may indicate their autochthonous origin. The synonymy cases found between local cultivars and Italian mainland cultivars indicate interchange of genetic material among these growing areas, suggesting thus a possible allochthonous origin. The information obtained can assist in the management of an olive collection and sheds some light on the survival of true oleasters and the origin of Sardinian cultivars.},

We aimed to compare europaea and cuspidata trees for oil content and composition and to verify whether natural hybrids may exist between the two subspecies. Specimens were from Kenya and putative natural hybrids between cuspidata and europaea were from Stellenbosch (South Africa). Cultivar and oleaster trees were sampled in France (continental and Corsica), Italy (Continental and Sardinia) and Tunisia. We have examined the fruit (drupe) structure between subsp. cuspidata and europaea and extracted oil from the pulp, seed and total drupe. Comparison for oil content was made between the cultivated olive and the oleaster and some cuspidata trees from Kenya. A few of cuspidata individuals from Botanical gardens do not enable phenotyping for oil content and composition. Oil composition analyses were performed for the main fatty acids to compare the three taxa. We used microsatellite markers at 11 loci to compute genetic distances between cuspidata, oleaster and cultivar trees and to reveal eventual hybrids. The SSR polymorphisms were huge between the two subspecies and they revealed that putative hybrids were true hybrids sampled around olive orchards. The whole comparison of oil content shows that olive cultivars display higher oil content than the subsp. cuspidata and that the oleaster trees are intermediate, whereas for oil composition of the drupe, cuspidata from Kenya shows less oleic acid than europaea. However, the cuspidata trees show seed oil composition similarities with the other two taxa. The discussion deals with possible reasons to explain the differences and of the possible uses of these taxa for breeding both the olive and brown olive.},

  abstract = {Genetic diversity and relationships between local cultivars and wild olive trees from three important Spanish olive-growing regions, Andalusia (South), Catalonia and Valencia (from Eastern Mediterranean Coastal area), were studied by means of eight SSR loci. Distinct allelic composition and heterozygosity levels were found in wild olive populations and cultivars. The observed patterns of genetic variation revealed: a) the independent clustering of Andalusian wild olives in a separate gene pool, b) the belonging of wild populations and most cultivars from Catalonia to another gene pool, c) the joined clustering of Andalusian and a set of Valencian cultivars in a third gene pool, and d) clustering of wild individuals from Valencia to the three different gene pools. These results suggest that wild populations of Andalusia may represent true oleasters, the ones from Catalonia may be feral forms derived from cultivar seed spreading, while the population of Valencia seems to be the most admixed one. The significant differentiation between Andalusian and most Catalonian cultivars is indicating an independent selection of olive cultivars in the two regions. The detection of a certain wild genetic background in some Catalonian and Valencian cultivars and the similarity found between wild and cultivated forms may suggest the use of local wild trees in olive domestication. The proposed scenario for the development of olive cultivars in Andalusia includes an empirical selection of outstanding local wild genotypes followed by various generations of crosses and various replanting campaigns, as well as possible introductions of ancestral cultivars. Therefore, our findings would lead us to support the hypothesis that the current diversity found in Spanish olive cultivars may be regionally differentiated and due to both, autochthonous and allochthonous origin. The information obtained in this work gives insights into the genetic resources of the main olive producing country, demonstrating that wild olive populations and local cultivars both represent potential sources of useful variability for olive breeding programs.},

Little is known on the genetic relationships between the olive crop and oleaster trees in Tunisia. Fifty-two oleaster trees and fifteen cultivars were sampled from Tunisia.

AFC analyses showed close genetic relationships between cultivated and oleaster trees. Genetic relationships were also displayed in a dendrogram based on Unweighted Pair Group Method (UPGMA). Five clusters were defined mixing cultivar and oleaster trees suggesting close relationship between some cultivar and some oleaster trees. One oleaster is single in a cluster.

  abstract = {. The study of genetic diversity within the olive-tree (cultivated and wild forms) may be useful to reveal agronomic traits in the wild germplasm and to try to understand the history of the olive-tree domestication. In this way, a study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs of cultivated and wild olives from two Corsican and Sardinian Mediterranean islands was performed using RAPD and RFLP markers. Our results show that most of the varieties and most of the oleasters were separated using the UPGMA dendrogram based on the Nei and Li similarity index. Most of oleasters carried either the MOM or MCK mitotype, characteristic of olives in the Western Mediterranean, whereas most of the varieties carried the ME1 mitotype, characteristic of olives in the East Mediterranean. The results indicate that the combination of mitotype and RAPD markers can be used as a powerful tool for differentiating two groups in the wild forms: the Western true oleasters and the feral forms. The true oleasters are characterized by a Western mitotype and a Western RAPD pattern. Feral forms originate either from varieties or from hybridisation between a variety and an oleaster. Consequently, as expected, some of them aggregated with the varieties from which they were derived. The other feral forms are clustered with the oleasters and were detected only by their mitotype determination. This study has also permitted us to differentiate two populations of cultivated olives in Corsica: one with close relationships with Italian varieties (influenced by the East) and one selected from local oleasters probably due to a better local adaptation than foreign varieties.},

Here, we unravel the history of wild olives (oleasters), and then infer the primary origins of the domesticated olive. Phylogeography and Bayesian molecular dating analyses based on plastid genome profiling of 1263 oleasters and 534 cultivated genotypes reveal three main lineages of pre-Quaternary origin. Regional hotspots of plastid diversity, species distribution modelling and macrofossils support the existence of three long-term refugia; namely the Near East (including Cyprus), the Aegean area and the Strait of Gibraltar. These ancestral wild gene pools have provided the essential foundations for cultivated olive breeding. Comparison of the geographical pattern of plastid diversity between wild and cultivated olives indicates the cradle of first domestication in the northern Levant followed by dispersals across the Mediterranean basin in parallel with the expansion of civilizations and human exchanges in this part of the world.},

Various subspecies have been identified morphologically, and more recently through molecular markers, among both wild and cultivated olives. Domestication of the olive was probably initiated in the eastern regions of Mediterranean basin, but selections for domestic use were performed independently at various locations. Based on the molecular analysis, a considerable mixture of the genomes of both wild and domesticated olive types occurred. Starting thousands of years ago a dispersion of olives took place, mainly in the old world. Many olive stands developed isolated from other olive types, and as a result are based on multiplication and crossovers of the original genome. These isolated geographical populations are presently referred to as different Olea europaea subspecies. Over multiple generations, these isolated populations developed resistance to specific adverse biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. The potential and significance of using these geographically isolated olive subspecies in olive breeding programs for the future industry is discussed.},

As the number of such platforms increases, it becomes urgently necessary to assess in which ways, for better or worse, this emergent phenomenon complements or disrupts the scholarly communications landscape. This article examines ethical, organizational, and economic strengths and weaknesses of such platforms, as well as usage and uptake to date, to scope the opportunities and threats presented by funder OA platforms in the ongoing transition to OA. The article is broadly supportive of the aims and current implementations of such platforms, finding them a novel intervention which stands to help increase OA uptake, control costs of OA, lower administrative burden on researchers, and demonstrate funders’ commitment to fostering open practices. However, the article identifies key areas of concern about the potential for unintended consequences, including the appearance of conflicts of interest, difficulties of scale, potential lock-in, and issues of the branding of research.

  abstract = {Olive cultivars are diversified but nothing is known on their origins and if they are local or introduced in any regions. The study aims to determine which traits may help to identify native from introduced cultivars and oleaster trees. We compared cultivars and oleasters from North Tunisia to determine their relationships based on morphological traits, oil composition and SSR genotyping at seven loci. We used those parameters to examine 32 cultivar trees from 17 denominations and 70 oleaster trees sampled. We used multivariate analysis, enabling to retain the best variables, to establish relationships among trees based on morphological and pomological parameters. Gas chromatography was used to determine fatty acid composition of 30 cultivar trees and 13 oleaster trees. We determined for one cultivar Gerboui the steady drupe, pit morphological and oil composition variation ranges in six different contrasted agro-systems. SSR genotyping was performed in polyacrylamide gels after fluorescent labelling. Based on morphology, oleaster trees from agro-ecosystems clustered broadly in an intermediate position between cultivars and oleasters from natural ecosystems. SSR revealed that the feral and genuine oleasters plus cultivars are always overlapping. Relationships between cultivars are displayed in two dendrograms. They revealed six and three main clusters based on Unweighted Pair Group Method (UPGMA) and Ward algorithm, respectively. They mix olive cultivar and oleaster trees suggesting kinship relationships between some cultivar and some oleaster trees. In contrast, on PCA, some morphological parameters split our sample approximately between olive and oleaster trees. Oil composition was similar between cultivar and oleaster trees. Kinship relationships between cultivar and oleaster trees based on molecular polymorphisms suggested that olive cultivars may have origin in local oleasters. Oil composition as fruit descriptors and drupe size appeared inefficient to discriminate between olive and oleaster trees, in comparison to SSR. Our results suggested several domestication events for the olive. It is important to know which cultivars have local origin to promote and sale products from Tunisia as from all around the Mediterranean basin.},

Cultivated olive clustered with Mediterranean and Saharan wild forms (clades E1 and E2). Strong genetic differentiation for cpDNA markers was observed between eastern and western Mediterranean olives, suggesting that these areas have represented different glacial refugia. Humans most likely spread one eastern chlorotype, preponderant in cultivars, across the western Mediterranean Basin.

The DNA fingerprints of these 45 trees were compared, and the genetic variability within and between groups within the population was partitioned using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). The AMOVA showed high genetic variation within each of the three putative groups of the population but there were no significant genetic differences between them. A dendrogram constructed using the simple matching coefficient with unweighted pair group mathematical average (UPGMA) clustering showed the presence of three clusters that persisted when the data were subjected to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). The three clusters obtained from molecular data were significantly different from one another. Each cluster consisted of at least one or more trees from the original grove and others from the population. Estimates of tree age were highly variable, but the overall trend supported the derivation of feral trees from the original grove. The distribution of these clusters within the population suggests that the predominant mode of feral spread was by fruit drop close to the parent trees, with occasional wider dispersal by animals or birds.},

We used 11 simple sequence repeat and 13 sequence-related amplified polymorphism markers to assess genetic variations and inter-relationships among the samples. The results of the analysis showed differences in the levels of allelic composition and heterozygosity between cultivated and wild olive trees. The observation of a high proportion of a certain wild-type genetic background in the cultivars may indicate the former use of local wild trees in olive domestication in Turkey, a possible autochthonal origin of cultivars. “Gemlik” was found to be the most common olive cultivar in the Marmara region and most of the wild olive samples from this region may be feral forms derived from cultivar seed spreading. The information obtained from this study can help to assist the management of an olive collection and sheds some light on the origin of Turkish olive cultivars.},

  abstract = {Geographical isolation and polyploidization are central concepts in plant evolution. The hierarchical organization of archipelagos in this study provides a framework for testing the evolutionary consequences for polyploid taxa and populations occurring in isolation. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers, we determined the genetic diversity and differentiation patterns at three levels of geographical isolation in Olea europaea: mainland-archipelagos, islands within an archipelago, and populations within an island. At the subspecies scale, the hexaploid ssp. maroccana (southwest Morocco) exhibited higher genetic diversity than the insular counterparts. In contrast, the tetraploid ssp. cerasiformis (Madeira) displayed values similar to those obtained for the diploid ssp. guanchica (Canary Islands). Geographical isolation was associated with a high genetic differentiation at this scale. In the Canarian archipelago, the stepping-stone model of differentiation suggested in a previous study was partially supported. Within the western lineage, an east-to-west differentiation pattern was confirmed. Conversely, the easternmost populations were more related to the mainland ssp. europaea than to the western guanchica lineage. Genetic diversity across the Canarian archipelago was significantly correlated with the date of the last volcanic activity in the area/island where each population occurs. At the island scale, this pattern was not confirmed in older islands (Tenerife and Madeira), where populations were genetically homogeneous. In contrast, founder effects resulted in low genetic diversity and marked genetic differentiation among populations of the youngest island, La Palma.},

  abstract = {We assessed the genetic differentiation of the Mediterranean olive from its wild relatives found in different geographic areas (Mediterranean, Asia, Africa) using eighty RAPDs revealed with eight primers. Variance analysis (AMOVA) enabled us to estimate the overall genetic differentiation parameters between wild populations. Oleasters from the Near East and Turkey were discriminated from the other Mediterranean populations. Olea laperrinei, O. maroccana and O. cerasiformis were the taxa the most related to the Mediterranean olive. In contrast, O. africana was shown to be the most genetically distant taxa from the Mediterranean olive. However, we characterised hybrid trees between these two taxa. Significant trends between genetic and geographic distances were met within the subspecies cuspidata and within the Mediterranean olive. A genetic diversity gradient was observed in both subspecies europaea and cuspidata. These results are in agreement with a mechanism of differentiation by distance in the O. europaea complex, but another non-exclusive mechanism could also be gene flow between differentiated taxa. Furthermore, we characterised the discriminating power of each RAPD to recognise the different taxa using intraclass correlation coefficients. Lastly, IGS-RFLPs enabled us to assess rDNA polymorphisms on a sub-sample of individuals. On the basis of these data, a low interspecifc differentiation was found. This suggests a recent genetic divergence between the different taxa of the O. europaea complex or the occurrence of gene flow during favourable periods or because human displacements. All the olive cultivars were genetically related to the oleaster populations supporting that Mediterranean is the olive domestication area.},

The ability to discriminate olive cultivars and determine their genetic variability is pivotal for an optimal exploitation of olive genetic resources. Methods We investigated the genetic diversity within 128 olive accessions belonging to four countries in the Mediterranean Basin (Italy, Algeria, Syria, and Malta), with the purpose of better understanding the origin and spread of the olive genotypes across Mediterranean Basin countries. Eleven highly polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used and proved to be very informative, producing a total of 179 alleles. Results Cluster analysis distinguished three main groups according to their geographical origin, with the current sample of Maltese accessions included in the Italian group. Phylogenetic analysis further differentiated Italian and Maltese olive accessions, clarifying the intermediate position of Maltese accessions along the x/y-axes of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Model-based and neighbor clustering, PCoA, and migration analysis suggested the existence of two different gene pools (Algerian and Syrian) and that the genetic exchange occurred between the Syrian, Italian and Maltese populations. Discussion The close relationship between Syrian and Italian and Maltese olives was consistent with the historical domestication and migration of olive tree from the North Levant to eastern Mediterranean basin. This study lays the foundations for a better understanding of olive genetic diversity in the Mediterranean basin and represents a step toward an optimal conservation and exploitation of olive genetic resources.},

Comparatively little is known about perennial plant domestication, a relevant topic for understanding how genes and genomes evolve in long-lived species, and how perennials respond to selection pressures operating on a relatively short time scale. Here, we focus on long-lived perennial crops (mainly trees and other woody plants) grown for their fruits. • Key results: We reviewed (1) the basic biology of long-lived perennials, setting the stage for perennial domestication by considering how these species evolve in nature; (2) the suite of morphological features associated with perennial fruit crops undergoing domestication; (3) the origins and evolution of domesticated perennials grown for their fruits; and (4) the genetic basis of domestication in perennial fruit crops. • Conclusions: Long-lived perennials have lengthy juvenile phases, extensive outcrossing, widespread hybridization, and limited population structure. Under domestication, these features, combined with clonal propagation, multiple origins, and ongoing crop–wild gene flow, contribute to mild domestication bottlenecks in perennial fruit crops. Morphological changes under domestication have many parallels to annual crops, but with key differences for mating system evolution and mode of reproduction. Quantitative trait loci associated with domestication traits in perennials are mainly of minor effect and may not be stable across years. Future studies that take advantage of genomic approaches and consider demographic history will elucidate the genetics of agriculturally and ecologically important traits in perennial fruit crops and their wild relatives.},

  abstract = {Six subspecies are currently recognized in the wild olive (Olea europaea L.): cuspidata, europaea, laperrinei, maroccana, cerasiformis, and guanchica. These occur in different natural distribution ranges in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Here we present an overview and summary of the accumulated information on the molecular diversity and gene flow in the species. Past climatic oscillations and geographical barriers have been identified to govern the pattern of genetic diversity and gene movement within and between taxa. Seed dispersal by animals and cultivar transport over vast geographical distances by man are important factors which have prevented the complete differentiation of subspecies. Available evidence has shown that subsp. cuspidata is the early diverging taxon of the olive complex. However, results were not fully consistent concerning the relationships between the other subspecies. Molecular studies using nuclear and cytoplasmic markers show that the oleasters (subsp. europaea var. sylvestris) are ancestors to the cultivated forms (subsp. europaea var. europaea). However, due to hybridization in geographical proximate regions sometimes other subspecies also have influenced the cultivars. This complex process has blurred the domestication history of the species. The wild relatives of the cultivated olive are endangered in many parts of their range, albeit being important for forest restoration. Overall, molecular studies have answered a number of important questions, but most of the genetic studies so far focused on the Mediterranean oleasters, while the widespread cuspidata has not been sufficiently investigated. Using genomic approaches to understand the pattern of genetic variation will be helpful to solve open questions. Moreover, future genetic studies should focus on quantifying the local effects of disturbance factors on genetic diversity and mating system parameters of wild olive.},

  abstract = {Aim The olive tree is considered one of the best indicators of the Mediterranean climate. The species’ distribution is associated with geographical and bioclimatic factors, as well as being influenced by a long period of cultivation. Despite concerted efforts of different research groups, the origin of the Mediterranean olive tree still remains elusive. In the present study, relationships between taxa and populations covering the entire range of Olea europaea were investigated using both maternal (plastid genome) and biparental (nuclear genome) markers to disclose evolutionary patterns in the olive complex. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical results of the two-genome analyses were interpreted in a biogeographical context. Location Mediterranean, temperate and subtropical floristic regions of the Old World. Methods Phylogeographical reconstructions of plastid DNA polymorphism were performed using microsatellites, restriction sites and indels on a wide sample of 185 representative trees across the Old World, including 28 herbarium specimens from remote areas. Additionally, the potential utility of one ITS-1 pseudogene for phylogenetic analyses was explored using Bayesian and maximum parsimony approaches on a subsample of 38 olive trees. Results Forty plastid haplotypes were recognized and split into two lineages and seven sublineages. The analysis of ITS-1 sequences also allowed the identification of seven well differentiated groups. Distribution of plastid and ribosomal DNA lineages was congruent, but particular cases of phylogenetic incongruence were disclosed (particularly in the Sahara and Madeira). Lastly, two divergent ITS-1 copies were isolated from the same sample of four individuals of different subspecies. Main conclusions Phylogenetic congruence of both ITS-1 and plastid lineages suggested an evolutionary scenario of predominant isolation during the Plio-Pleistocene in Macaronesia, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, eastern Africa and Asia. The Saharan desert appeared to have played an important role of vicariant barrier between southern and northern African populations in early times. Incongruence of some plastid and nuclear results, as well as intermingled ITS-1 copies of different lineages in single individuals, was interpreted as a result of recurrent reticulation events in the olive complex. We identified an ancient hybrid zone from the Sahara to north-eastern African mountains, where divergent plastid and nuclear lineages still co-exist. Results of this paper, and previous studies, suggest that the cultivated olive originated from a pre-Quaternary Mediterranean ancestor, with no evidence for a recent hybrid origin. In contrast, a continuous process of olive domestication through local hybridization events of cultivated trees with natural populations may have brought about a remarkably high genomic diversity among cultivated trees across the Mediterranean.},

  abstract = {A wide genetic diversity has been reported for wild olives, which could be particularly interesting for the introgression of some agronomic traits and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses in breeding programs. However, the introgression of some beneficial wild traits may be paralleled by negative effects on some other important agronomic and quality traits. From the quality point of view, virgin olive oil (VOO) from olive cultivars is highly appreciated for its fatty acid composition (high monounsaturated oleic acid content) and the presence of several minor components. However, the composition of VOO from wild origin and its comparison with VOO from olive cultivars has been scarcely studied. In this work, the variability for fruit characters (fruit weight and oil content), fatty acid composition, and minor quality components (squalene, sterols and tocopherols content and composition) was studied in a set of plant materials involving three different origins: wild genotypes (n=32), cultivars (n=62) and genotypes belonging to cultivar x wild progenies (n=62). As expected, values for fruit size and oil content in wild olives were lower than those obtained in cultivated materials, with intermediate values for cultivar x wild progenies. Wild olives showed a remarkably higher C16:0 percentage and tocopherol content in comparison to the cultivars. Contrarily, lower C18:1 percentage, squalene and sterol content were found in the wild genotypes, while no clear differences were found among the different plant materials regarding composition of the tocopherol and phytosterol fractions. Some common highly significant correlations among components of the same chemical family were found in all groups of plant materials. However, some other correlations were specific for one of the groups. The results of the study suggested that the use of wild germplasm in olive breeding programs will not have a negative impact on fatty acid composition, tocopherol content, and tocopherol and phytosterol profiles provided that selection for these compounds is conducted from early generations. Important traits such as tocopherol content could be even improved by using wild parents.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1708621114},
  abstract = {Here we present the genome sequence and annotation of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), called oleaster, which is considered an ancestor of cultivated olive trees. More than 50,000 protein-coding genes were predicted, a majority of which could be anchored to 23 pseudochromosomes obtained through a newly constructed genetic map. The oleaster genome contains signatures of two Oleaceae lineage-specific paleopolyploidy events, dated at ∼28 and ∼59 Mya. These events contributed to the expansion and neofunctionalization of genes and gene families that play important roles in oil biosynthesis. The functional divergence of oil biosynthesis pathway genes, such as FAD2, SACPD, EAR, and ACPTE, following duplication, has been responsible for the differential accumulation of oleic and linoleic acids produced in olive compared with sesame, a closely related oil crop. Duplicated oleaster FAD2 genes are regulated by an siRNA derived from a transposable element-rich region, leading to suppressed levels of FAD2 gene expression. Additionally, neofunctionalization of members of the SACPD gene family has led to increased expression of SACPD2, 3, 5, and 7, consequently resulting in an increased desaturation of steric acid. Taken together, decreased FAD2 expression and increased SACPD expression likely explain the accumulation of exceptionally high levels of oleic acid in olive. The oleaster genome thus provides important insights into the evolution of oil biosynthesis and will be a valuable resource for oil crop genomics. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

  abstract = {Wild olives or oleaster (Olea europaea ssp. oleaster) are found naturally in the Mediterranean basin. The changes in climate and environmental conditions have been gradually accelerating in the last decades. Since oleasters are more resistant to diseases, pests and unfavorable environmental conditions, they have become a very important source for resistance breeding studies that would be required in the future. Twelve inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and 12 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used; the effectiveness of these markers was studied and different parameters such as effective multiplex ratio, marker index, resolving power, and polymorphic information content, Shannon information index (I), effective allele number (ne), and Nei's genetic distance (h) were used in the determination of genetic varieties of 18 oleasters grown in Turkey. When both marker systems were analyzed in this study, it was observed that MI, RP and EMR parameters in ISSR gave higher values than RAPD while ne, I, and h were lower in ISSRs. Neighbour-joining dendrograms were developed by using Nei's genetic distance matrix, and principal coordinate analysis was performed. © 2017 The Author(s).

  abstract = {The genus Olea contains about 30 species were grouped into three subgenera, Tetrapilus, Paniculatae, and Olea (cultivated olive and wild relatives), found in Asia, Australia and Asia, Africa and Europe, respectively. The species O. europaea L. includes six subspecies: Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea (the Mediterranean olives); O. e. laperrinei (distributed in Saharan massifs of Hoggar, Aïr, Jebel Marra in Algeria); O. e. cuspidata (which moved from South Africa to Egypt, East Australian areas and Hawaii, and from Arabia to northern India and Southwest China); O. e. guanchica (Canary Islands); O. e. maroccana (southwestern Morocco); and O. e. cerasiformis (Madeira).Using molecular markers, it has been ascertained that the Mediterranean olives include the cultivated types (O. europaea L. ssp. europaea var. sativa), the true wild oleaster (O. e. e. var. sylvestris), and the feral form olevaster from seedlings raised from seeds of the cultivated types. The oleaster has a narrow range of distribution and it is often mistaken for olevaster. Recolonization of the Mediterranean basin by Oleaster occurred after the last glacial event, from refuges located in both eastern and western Mediterranean basin areas toward southern Europe. Oleaster is a source of rootstock for propagating new improved cultivated varieties. Cultivated and wild forms have the same diploid chromosome number (2n = 46) and are fully interfertile. Triploid and tetraploid genotypes have been isolated from cultivated O.e.e., but polyploid forms have been found in endangered natural populations of O. e. guancica (tetraploid) and O. e. maroccana (hexaploid).Individual oleaster trees showing superior performance for size and/or oil content of fruit were selected empirically during olive domestication and propagated vegetatively as clones using cuttings that were planted directly or, more recently, grafted onto indigenous oleasters.Genetic markers linked for most important agronomic traits, such as size of the tree, content of secondary products of fruit, flowering induction, oil quality, and biotic and abiotic resistance, will help introgression by conventional breeding of oleaster trait-enhancing genes into cultivated olive. Successful results were difficult to achieve due to both the complex genetic basis of the traits to be improved and the long juvenile period of the progenies that delays the expression of the target traits. In vitro techniques to regenerate doubled haploids from hybrids or somaclonal variation induction may complement classical breeding procedures. Genetic transformation could speed up the development of new genotypes, and transgenic olive plants with modified growth habit and putative induced disease resistance are being tested under filed conditions. However, the development of an efficient regeneration method from mature tissue is the limiting factor for the routine application of this technology to olive genetic improvement.},

In the present study, we focused on the olives growing on twoMediterranean islands, Corsica and Sardinia. On these two islands, there areolives with many denominations, as well as forests of oleasters. Here, it wasproposed to determine the relationships among cultivated and wild olives.Some Italian denominations were studied in addition to assess the influenceof the mainland on the two islands in this respect.The 59 RAPD markers obtained showed the existence of manysynonymous, and homonymous. A dendrogram was constructed using theUPGMA method and a FCA was carried out. The results of these twoanalyses showed the existence of a genetic divergence between the oleastersand the cultivated varieties. They suggest that some of the Corsicanvarieties were probably selected from local wild forms, contrary to theSardinian varieties. They also show that there are feral forms growing onboth islands, which result from hybridization between oleasters andvarieties.},

  abstract = {The Mediterranean region has more than 25 million hectares of Mediterranean forests and about 50 million hectares of other Mediterranean wooded lands. They make crucial contributions to rural development, poverty alleviation, food security, as well as, the agricultural, water, tourism, and energy sectors. Changes in climate, societies, and lifestyles to create appropriate financial incentives and tools. in the Mediterranean region could have serious negative consequences for forests, with the potential to lead to the loss or diminution of those contributions and to a wide range of economic, social and environmental problems. In the future, Mediterranean forests will support agriculture and human wellbeing. It is therefore crucial to improve policies, practices, and to promote sustainable management to provide social and economic benefits as well as to increase the resilience of ecosystems and societies. This new edition of the State of Mediterranean Forests aims to demonstrate the importance of Mediterranean forests to implementing solutions to tackle global issues such as climate change and population increase.

Part 1: The Mediterranean landscape: importance and threats. Despite the important natural capital provided by Mediterranean forests, they are under threats from climate change and population increase and other subsidiary drivers of forest degradation.

Part 2: Mediterranean forest-based solutions. Forests and landscape restoration, adaptation of forests and adaptation using forests, climate change mitigation, and conserving biodiversity are additional and complementary approaches to address the drivers of forest degradation to the benefit of populations and the environment.

Part 3: Creating an enabling environment to scale up solutions. To scale up and replicate forest-based solutions, there is a need to change the way we see the role of forests in the economy, to put in place relevant policies, more widespread participatory approaches, to recognize the economic value of the goods and services provided by forests and, ultimately, to create appropriate financial incentives and tools.},

  abstract = {Climate change and human activity are dooming species at an unprecedented rate via a plethora of direct and indirect, often synergic, mechanisms. Among these, primary extinctions driven by environmental change could be just the tip of an enormous extinction iceberg. As our understanding of the importance of ecological interactions in shaping ecosystem identity advances, it is becoming clearer how the disappearance of consumers following the depletion of their resources — a process known as ‘co-extinction’ — is more likely the major driver of biodiversity loss. Although the general relevance of co-extinctions is supported by a sound and robust theoretical background, the challenges in obtaining empirical information about ongoing (and past) co-extinction events complicate the assessment of their relative contributions to the rapid decline of species diversity even in well-known systems, let alone at the global scale. By subjecting a large set of virtual Earths to different trajectories of extreme environmental change (global heating and cooling), and by tracking species loss up to the complete annihilation of all life either accounting or not for co-extinction processes, we show how ecological dependencies amplify the direct effects of environmental change on the collapse of planetary diversity by up to ten times.},

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workﬂow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a ‘DevOps’ philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

Does the combination of these statistical procedures and current standards of data archiving and method reporting permit the reproduction of the authors' results? To test this, we reanalysed data sets gathered from papers using the software package structure to identify genetically similar clusters of individuals. We find that reproducing structure results can be difficult despite the straightforward requirements of the program. Our results indicate that 30\% of analyses were unable to reproduce the same number of population clusters. To improve this, we make recommendations for future use of the software and for reporting structure analyses and results in published works.},

Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005–2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

  abstract = {American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was transformed with a wheat oxalate oxidase (oxo) gene in an effort to degrade the oxalic acid (OA) secreted by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, thus decreasing its virulence. Expression of OxO was examined under two promoters: a strong constitutive promoter, CaMV 35S, and a predominantly vascular promoter, VspB. Oxo gene transcription was quantified by RT-qPCR. Relative expression of OxO varied approximately 200 fold among events produced with the 35S-OxO. The lowest 35S-OxO event expressed approximately 3,000 fold higher than the highest VspB-OxO event. This was potentially due to the tissue-specific nature of the VspB-controlled expression, the strength of the CaMV 35S constitutive promoter, or position effects. Leaf assays measuring necrotic lesion length were conducted to better understand the relationship between OxO expression level and the blight fungus in planta. A threshold response was observed between the OxO expression level and the C. parasitica lesion length. Five events of the 35S-OxO line showed significantly reduced lesion length compared to the blight-susceptible American chestnut. More importantly, the lesion length in these five events was reduced to the same level as the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, C. mollissima. This is the first report on enhanced pathogen resistance in transgenic American chestnut.},

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans— the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

Isolation of these QTLs holds great promise to improve world agriculture but is a challenging task. We previously mapped a rice QTL, SKC1, that maintained K+ homeostasis in the salt-tolerant variety under salt stress1, consistent with the earlier finding that K+ homeostasis is important in salt tolerance2,3. To understand the molecular basis of this QTL, we isolated the SKC1 gene by map-based cloning and found that it encoded a member of HKT-type transporters. SKC1 is preferentially expressed in the parenchyma cells surrounding the xylem vessels. Voltage-clamp analysis showed that SKC1 protein functions as a Na+-selective transporter. Physiological analysis suggested that SKC1 is involved in regulating K+/Na+ homeostasis under salt stress, providing a potential tool for improving salt tolerance in crops.},

  abstract = {Epigenetics refers to heritable alterations in chromatin architecture that do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence but profoundly affect gene expression and impact cellular function. Epigenetic regulation is attained by specific mechanisms involving DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications and the action of noncoding (nc) RNAs which lead to open or closed chromatin states associated with gene activation or gene silencing, respectively. Over the past two decades extensive investigations have provided a wealth of information on epigenetic regulation at specific loci both in model and crop plants and the effect it may have on various aspects of plant development such as proper vegetative growth, successful reproduction and viability, effects on yield, and efficiency in coping with stress. In recent years, the rapid progress of high-throughput technologies has led to the unveiling of epigenetic landscapes at genome-wide scale (epigenomes) exemplified by the deciphering of the full methylomes, at single base resolution, of the model plant Arabidopsis and crop plants such as rice and tomato. An increasing number of epigenomes are now being investigated on crops of high economic value. Transgenerational natural or induced epigenetic variation can be a new source of phenotypic diversity especially for species with low genetic variation. The comparison of different epigenomes arising from different genotypes/tissues/cell types/environmental conditions can offer valuable information for the development of biomarkers paving the way to what is nowadays termed plant epibreeding. This review will attempt a comprehensive presentation of the progress in plant epigenetics both at small scale (single locus) and large scale (epigenome-wide) during development and in response to environmental stress, focusing on agronomically important crops and the impact that epigenetics, epigenomics and the new emerging field of epibreeding may have on crop improvement.},

Generally, diversity panels genotyped with high density SNP panels are utilized in order to assay a wide range of alleles and haplotypes and to monitor recombination breakpoints across the genome. By contrast, GWAS have not generally been performed in breeding populations. In this study we performed association mapping for 19 agronomic traits including yield and yield components in a breeding population of elite irrigated tropical rice breeding lines so that the results would be more directly applicable to breeding than those from a diversity panel. The population was genotyped with 71,710 SNPs using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), and GWAS performed with the explicit goal of expediting selection in the breeding program. Using this breeding panel we identified 52 QTL for 11 agronomic traits, including large effect QTLs for flowering time and grain length/grain width/grain-length-breadth ratio. We also identified haplotypes that can be used to select plants in our population for short stature (plant height), early flowering time, and high yield, and thus demonstrate the utility of association mapping in breeding populations for informing breeding decisions. We conclude by exploring how the newly identified significant SNPs and insights into the genetic architecture of these quantitative traits can be leveraged to build genomic-assisted selection models.},

To further broaden NGS usages to large crop genomes such as maize and wheat, genotyping by sequencing (GBS) has been developed and applied in sequencing multiplexed samples that combine molecular marker discovery and genotyping. GBS is a novel application of NGS protocols for discovering and genotyping SNPs in crop genomes and populations. The GBS approach includes the digestion of genomic DNA with restriction enzymes followed by the ligation of barcode adapter, PCR amplification and sequencing of the amplified DNA pool on a single lane of flow cells. Bioinformatic pipelines are needed to analyze and interpret GBS datasets. As an ultimate MAS tool and a cost-effective technique, GBS has been successfully used in implementing genome-wide association study (GWAS), genomic diversity study, genetic linkage analysis, molecular marker discovery and genomic selection (GS) under a large scale of plant breeding programs.},

The protected areas designated ever since under national and regional (EU) legislation, as well as under international Conventions and their protection status is presented in detail. Most of the protected areas though, that cover almost one third of the country, have been focusing mainly on nature conservation (ecosystem, species level) and not to the conservation of genetic resources, even if within the general protection framework they were also indirectly conserved. Focused activities aiming towards the dynamic conservation (maintenance of forest tree genetic diversity to ensure the evolutionary continued processes and not just the preservation of existing frequencies of genotypes and alleles) were initiated after the participation of the country in the EUFORGEN program and the EUFGIS project. Dynamic gene conservation units (GCUs) have been designated so far for a number of species, but the process of designation needs to be intensified, given the role of the country as a biodiversity hotspot and an area of high endemism.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a review of theoretical and practical aspects related to genetic management of forest trees. The implementation of international commitments on forest genetic diversity has been slow and partly neglected. Conservation of forest genetic diversity is still riddled with problems, and complexities of national legal and administrative structures. Europe is an example of a complex region where the distribution ranges of tree species extend across large geographical areas with profound environmental differences, and include many countries. Conservation of forest genetic diversity in Europe has been hampered by a lack of common understanding on the management requirements for genetic conservation units of forest trees. The challenge resides in integrating scientiﬁc knowledge on conservation genetics into management of tree populations so that recommendations are feasible to implement across different countries. Here, we present pan-European minimum requirements for dynamic conservation units of forest genetic diversity. The units are natural or man-made tree populations which are managed for maintaining evolutionary processes and adaptive potential across generations. Each unit should have a designated status and a management plan, and one or more tree species recognized as target species for genetic conservation. The minimum sizes of the units are set at 500, 50 or 15 reproducing individuals depending on tree species and conservation objectives. Furthermore, silvicultural interventions should be allowed to enhance genetic processes, as needed, and ﬁeld inventories carried out to monitor regeneration and the population size. These minimum requirements are now used by 36 countries to improve management of forest genetic diversity.},

  abstract = {How easy is it to reproduce the results found in a typical computational biology paper? Either through experience or intuition the reader will already know that the answer is with difficulty or not at all. In this paper we attempt to quantify this difficulty by reproducing a previously published paper for different classes of users (ranging from users with little expertise to domain experts) and suggest ways in which the situation might be improved. Quantification is achieved by estimating the time required to reproduce each of the steps in the method described in the original paper and make them part of an explicit workflow that reproduces the original results. Reproducing the method took several months of effort, and required using new versions and new software that posed challenges to reconstructing and validating the results. The quantification leads to “reproducibility maps” that reveal that novice researchers would only be able to reproduce a few of the steps in the method, and that only expert researchers with advance knowledge of the domain would be able to reproduce the method in its entirety. The workflow itself is published as an online resource together with supporting software and data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the complexities of requiring reproducibility in terms of cost versus benefit, and a desiderata with our observations and guidelines for improving reproducibility. This has implications not only in reproducing the work of others from published papers, but reproducing work from one’s own laboratory.},

While such data present new opportunities for evaluating population structure and demographic processes, the large size of these genomic data sets brings new computational challenges for researchers needing to parse, convert and manipulate data often into a variety of software-speciﬁc formats required of genomic analyses. We developed GENEPOPEDIT as a ﬂexible tool for the manipulation of multilocus molecular data sets. Functionality can be divided among diagnostic-, manipulation-, sampling-, simulation-, and transformation-based tools. Metadata from large genomic data sets can be efﬁciently extracted, without the need to view data in a text-editing program. GENEPOPEDIT provides tools to manipulate loci, individual samples and populations included in genomic data sets, in addition to the ability to convert directly to a variety of software formats. Functions are compiled as an R package, which can integrate into existing analysis workﬂows. Importantly, GENEPOPEDIT provides a simple yet robust code-based tool for repeatable genomic data manipulation, which has been proven to be stable for data sets in excess of 200 000 SNPs. The latest version of the package and associated documentation are available on Github (github.com/rystanley/genepopedit).},

  abstract = {Genetic sequences of multiple genes are becoming increasingly common for a wide range of organisms including viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. While such data may sometimes be treated as a single locus, in practice, a number of biological and statistical phenomena can lead to phylogenetic incongruence. In such cases, different loci should, at least as a preliminary step, be examined and analysed separately. The r software has become a popular platform for phylogenetics, with several packages implementing distance-based, parsimony and likelihood-based phylogenetic reconstruction, and an even greater number of packages implementing phylogenetic comparative methods. Unfortunately, basic data structures and tools for analysing multiple genes have so far been lacking, thereby limiting potential for investigating phylogenetic incongruence. In this study, we introduce the new r package apex to fill this gap. apex implements new object classes, which extend existing standards for storing DNA and amino acid sequences, and provides a number of convenient tools for handling, visualizing and analysing these data. In this study, we introduce the main features of the package and illustrate its functionalities through the analysis of a simple data set.},

These genomic data sets are often high dimensional, with complex correlation structures among variables, making it a challenge to identify outliers in a robust way. The Mahalanobis distance has been widely used, but has the major limitation of assuming that data follow a simple parametric distribution. Here, we develop three new metrics that can be used to identify outliers in multivariate space, while making no strong assumptions about the distribution of the data. These metrics are implemented in the R package MINOTAUR, which also includes an interactive web-based application for visualizing outliers in high-dimensional data sets. We illustrate how these metrics can be used to identify outliers from simulated genetic data and discuss some of the limitations they may face in application.},

  abstract = {Software to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms or related genetic variants has converged on the variant call format (VCF) as the output format of choice. This has created a need for tools to work with VCF ﬁles. While an increasing number of software exists to read VCF data, many only extract the genotypes without including the data associated with each genotype that describes its quality. We created the R package VCFR to address this issue. We developed a VCF ﬁle exploration tool implemented in the R language because R provides an interactive experience and an environment that is commonly used for genetic data analysis. Functions to read and write VCF ﬁles into R as well as functions to extract portions of the data and to plot summary statistics of the data are implemented. VCFR further provides the ability to visualize how various parameterizations of the data affect the results. Additional tools are included to integrate sequence (FASTA) and annotation data (GFF) for visualization of genomic regions such as chromosomes. Conversion functions translate data from the VCFR data structure to formats used by other R genetics packages. Computationally intensive functions are implemented in C++ to improve performance. Use of these tools is intended to facilitate VCF data exploration, including intuitive methods for data quality control and easy export to other R packages for further analysis. VCFR thus provides essential, novel tools currently not available in R.},

Genealogical data describe the timed ancestral relationships of individuals sampled from a population of interest. Here, individuals are assumed to be sampled at the same point in time (isochronous sampling) or at different points in time (heterochronous sampling); in addition, sampling events can be modelled with preferential sampling, which means that the intensity of sampling events is allowed to depend on the effective population size trajectory. We assume the coalescent and the sequentially Markov coalescent processes as generative models of genealogies. We include several coalescent simulation functions that are useful for testing our phylodynamics methods via simulation studies. We compare the performance and outputs of various methods implemented in phylodyn and outline their strengths and weaknesses. r package phylodyn is available at https://github.com/mdkarcher/phylodyn.},

Currently, skelesim implements coalescent and forward-time models available in the fastsimcoal2 and rmetasim simulation engines to produce null distributions for multiple population genetic statistics and marker types, under a variety of demographic conditions. skelesim is intended to make simulations easier while still allowing full model complexity to ensure that simulations play a fundamental role in molecular ecology investigations. skelesim can also serve as a teaching tool: demonstrating the outcomes of stochastic population genetic processes; teaching general concepts of simulations; and providing an introduction to the R environment with a user-friendly graphical user interface (using shiny).},

A recent Bayesian algorithm implemented in the software STRUCTURE allows the identification of such groups. However, the ability of this algorithm to detect the true number of clusters ( K ) in a sample of individuals when patterns of dispersal among populations are not homogeneous has not been tested. The goal of this study is to carry out such tests, using various dispersal scenarios from data generated with an individualbased model. We found that in most cases the estimated ‘log probability of data’ does not provide a correct estimation of the number of clusters, K. However, using an ad hoc statistic ∆K based on the rate of change in the log probability of data between successive K values, we found that STRUCTURE accurately detects the uppermost hierarchical level of structure for the scenarios we tested. As might be expected, the results are sensitive to the type of genetic marker used (AFLP vs. microsatellite), the number of loci scored, the number of populations sampled, and the number of individuals typed in each sample.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that the mean ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size, which we term M, calculated from a population sample of microsatellite loci, can be used to detect reductions in population size. Using simulations, we show that, for a general class of mutation models, the value of M decreases when a population is reduced in size. The magnitude of the decrease is positively correlated with the severity and duration of the reduction in size. We also find that the rate of recovery of M following a reduction in size is positively correlated with post-reduction population size, but that recovery occurs in both small and large populations. This indicates that M can distinguish between populations that have been recently reduced in size and those which have been small for a long time. We employ M to develop a statistical test for recent reductions in population size that can detect such changes for more than 100 generations with the post-reduction demographic scenarios we examine. We also compute M for a variety of populations and species using microsatellite data collected from the literature. We find that the value of M consistently predicts the reported demographic history for these populations. This method, and others like it, promises to be an important tool for the conservation and management of populations that are in need of intervention or recovery.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of polyploidy and the increasing availability of new genomic data, there remain important gaps in our knowledge of polyploid population genetics. These gaps arise from the complex nature of polyploid data (e.g. multiple alleles and loci, mixed inheritance patterns, association between ploidy and mating system variation). Furthermore, many of the standard tools for population genetics that have been developed for diploids are often not feasible for polyploids. This review aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in polyploid population genetics and to identify the main areas where further development of molecular techniques and statistical theory is required. We review commonly used molecular tools (amplified fragment length polymorphism, microsatellites, Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing and derived technologies) and their challenges associated with their use in polyploid populations: that is, allele dosage determination, null alleles, difficulty of distinguishing orthologues from paralogues and copy number variation. In addition, we review the approaches that have been used for population genetic analysis in polyploids and their specific problems. These problems are in most cases directly associated with dosage uncertainty and the problem of inferring allele frequencies and assumptions regarding inheritance. This leads us to conclude that for advancing the field of polyploid population genetics, most priority should be given to development of new molecular approaches that allow efficient dosage determination, and to further development of analytical approaches to circumvent dosage uncertainty and to accommodate ‘flexible’ modes of inheritance. In addition, there is a need for more simulation-based studies that test what kinds of biases could result from both existing and novel approaches.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the population genetics analysis of autopolyploid species faces many difficulties due to (i) limited development of population genetics tools under polysomic inheritance, (ii) difficulties to assess allelic dosage when genotyping individuals, (iii) a form of inbreeding resulting from the mechanism of “double reduction”. Consequently, few data analysis computer programs are applicable to autopolyploids. To contribute bridging this gap, this article first derives theoretical expectations for the inbreeding and identity disequilibium coefficients under polysomic inheritance in a mixed mating model. Moment estimators of these coefficients are proposed when exact genotypes or just markers phenotypes (i.e. allelic dosage unknown) are available. This led to the development of estimators of the selfing rate based on adult genotypes or phenotypes and applicable to any even-ploidy level. Their statistical performances and robustness were assessed by numerical simulations. Contrary to inbreeding based estimators, the identity disequilibrium based estimator using phenotypes is robust (absolute bias generally $<$ 0.05), even in the presence of double reduction, null alleles, or biparental inbreeding due to isolation by distance. A fairly good precision of the selfing rate estimates (root mean squared error $<$ 0.1) is already achievable using a sample of 3050 individuals phenotyped at 10 loci bearing 5-10 alleles each, conditions reachable using microsatellite markers. Diallelic markers (e.g. SNP) can also perform satisfactorily in diploids and tetraploids but more polymorphic markers are necessary for higher ploidy levels. The method is implemented in the software SPAGeDi and should contribute to reduce the lack of population genetics tools applicable to autopolyploids.},

  abstract = {Studying the population history and demography of organisms with important ecological roles can aid understanding of evolutionary processes at the community level and inform conservation. We screened genetic variation (mtDNA and microsatellite) across the populations of the southern grey shrike (Lanius meridionalis koenigi) in the Canary Islands, where it is an endemic subspecies and an important secondary seed disperser. We show that the Canarian subspecies is polyphyletic with L.~meridionalis elegans from North Africa and that shrikes have colonized the Canary Islands from North Africa multiple times. Substantial differences in genetic diversity exist across islands, which are most likely the product of a combination of historical colonization events and recent bottlenecks. The Eastern Canary Islands had the highest overall levels of genetic diversity and have probably been most recently and/or frequently colonized from Africa. Recent or ongoing bottlenecks were detected in three of the islands and are consistent with anecdotal evidence of population declines due to human disturbance. These findings are troubling given the shrike's key ecological role in the Canary Islands, and further research is needed to understand the community-level consequences of declines in shrike populations. Finally, we found moderate genetic differentiation among populations, which largely reflected the shrike's bottleneck history; however, a significant pattern of isolation-by-distance indicated that some gene flow occurs between islands. This study is a useful first step toward understanding how secondary seed dispersal operates over broad spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Germplasm collections are basic tools for conservation, characterization, and efficient use of olive genetic resources. The identification of the olive cultivars maintained in the collections is an important ongoing task which has been performed by both, morphological and molecular markers. In the present study, based on the sequencing results of previous genomic projects, a new set of 1,043 EST-SNP markers has been identified. In order to evaluate its discrimination capacity and utility in diversity studies, this set of markers was used in a representative number of accessions from 20 different olive growing countries and maintained at the World Olive Germplasm Collection of IFAPA Centre ‘Alameda del Obispo’ (Córdoba, Spain), one of the world’s largest olive germplasm bank. Thus, the cultivated material included: cultivars belonging to previously defined core collections by means of SSR markers and agronomical traits, well known homonymy cases, possible redundancies previously identified in the collection, and recently introduced accessions. Marker stability was tested in repeated analyses of a selected number of accessions, as well as in different trees and accessions belonging to the same cultivar. In addition, 15 genotypes from a cross ‘Picual’ × ‘Arbequina’ cultivars from the IFAPA olive breeding program and a set of 89 wild genotypes were also included in the study. Our results indicate that, despite their relatively wide variability, the new set of EST-SNPs displayed lower levels of genetic diversity than SSRs in the set of olive core collections tested. However, the EST-SNP markers displayed consistent and reliable results from different plant material sources and plant propagation events. The EST-SNPs revealed a clear cut off between inter- and intra-cultivar variation in olive. Besides, they were able to reliably discriminate among different accessions, to detect possible homonymy cases as well as efficiently ascertain the presence of redundant germplasm in the collection. Additionally, these markers were highly transferable to the wild genotypes. These results, together with the low genotyping error rates and the easy and fully automated procedure used to get the genotyping data, validate the new set of EST-SNPs as possible markers of choice for olive cultivar identification.},

We called close to 5M sequence variants (SNPs, MNPs and indels) and noticed that the number of unique haplotypes had plateaued within this set of germplasm (1.7M tag SNPs). This data set proved highly accurate (98.6\%) based on a comparison of called genotypes at loci shared with a SNP array. We used this catalogue of SNPs as a reference panel to impute missing genotypes at untyped loci in data sets derived from lower density genotyping tools (150 K GBS-derived SNPs/530 samples). After imputation, 96.4\% of the missing genotypes imputed in this fashion proved to be accurate. Using a combination of three bioinformatics pipelines, we uncovered \textasciitilde{}92 K SVs (deletions, insertions, inversions, duplications, CNVs and translocations) and estimated that over 90\% of these were accurate. Finally, we noticed that the duplication of certain genomic regions explained much of the residual heterozygosity at SNP loci in otherwise highly inbred soya bean accessions. This is the ﬁrst time that a comprehensive description of both SNP haplotype diversity and SV has been achieved within a regionally relevant subset of a major crop.},

The evaluation revealed 2365,363 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 394,365 insertions and deletions, and 47,567 copy number variations among the six genomes. Chromosomes 5 and 10 showed relatively high SNP densities, whereas whole-genome diversity in this population was low. In addition, some chromosomal loci exhibited obvious selection during the breeding process. Sorghum accessions from southwest China formed an elite germplasm population compared with the findings of other geographic populations, and the elite variety ‘Hongyingzi’ contained 79 unique genes primarily involved in basic metabolism. The six sorghum lines contained a large number of high-confidence genes, with Hongyingzi in particular possessing 104 unique genes. These findings advance our understanding of domestication of the sorghum genome, and Chinese sorghum accessions will be valuable resources for further research and breeding improvements.},

Of these, P. ferganensis have been classified as a species, subspecies, or geographical population of P. persica. To explore the genetic difference between P. ferganensis and P. persica, high-throughput sequencing was used in different peach accessions belonging to different species. First, low-depth sequencing data of peach accessions belonging to four categories revealed that similarity between P. ferganensis and P. persica was similar to that between P. persica accessions from different geographical populations. Then, to further detect the genomic variation in P. ferganensis, the P. ferganensis accession BXinjiang Pan Tao 1\^ and the P. persica accession BXia Miao 1\^ were sequenced with high depth, and sequence reads were assembled. The results showed that the collinearity of BXinjiang Pan Tao 1\^ with the reference genome BLovell\^ was higher than that of BXia Miao 1\^ and BLovell\^ peach. Additionally, the number of genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variations (SVs), and the specific genes annotated from unmapped sequence in BXia Miao 1\^ was higher than that in BXinjiang Pan Tao 1\^ peach. The data showed that there was a close distance between BXinjiang Pan Tao 1\^ (P. ferganensis) and reference genome which belong to P. persica, comparing BXia Miao 1\^ (P. persica) and reference ones. The results accompany with phylogenetic tree and structure analysis confirmed that P. ferganensis should be considered as a geographic population of P. persica rather than a subspecies or a distinct species. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis was performed using the gene comprising large-effect variation to understand the phenotypic difference between two accessions. The result revealed that the pathways of gene function affected by SVs but SNPs and insertion-deletions markedly differed between the two peach accessions.},

  abstract = {Many of our major crop species are polyploids, containing more than one genome or set of chromosomes. Polyploid crops present unique challenges, including difficulties in genome assembly, in discriminating between multiple gene and sequence copies, and in genetic mapping, hindering use of genomic data for genetics and breeding. Polyploid genomes may also be more prone to containing structural variation, such as loss of gene copies or sequences (presence–absence variation) and the presence of genes or sequences in multiple copies (copynumber variation). Although the two main types of genomic structural variation commonly identified are presence–absence variation and copy-number variation, we propose that homeologous exchanges constitute a third major form of genomic structural variation in polyploids. Homeologous exchanges involve the replacement of one genomic segment by a similar copy from another genome or ancestrally duplicated region, and are known to be extremely common in polyploids. Detecting all kinds of genomic structural variation is challenging, but recent advances such as optical mapping and long-read sequencing offer potential strategies to help identify structural variants even in complex polyploid genomes. All three major types of genomic structural variation (presence–absence, copy-number, and homeologous exchange) are now known to influence phenotypes in crop plants, with examples of flowering time, frost tolerance, and adaptive and agronomic traits. In this review, we summarize the challenges of genome analysis in polyploid crops, describe the various types of genomic structural variation and the genomics technologies and data that can be used to detect them, and collate information produced to date related to the impact of genomic structural variation on crop phenotypes. We highlight the importance of genomic structural variation for the future genetic improvement of polyploid crops.},

  abstract = {Key message  Structural genome variation is a major determinant of useful trait diversity. We describe how genome analysis methods are enabling discovery of trait-associated structural variants and their potential impact on breeding. Abstract  As our understanding of complex crop genomes continues to grow, there is growing evidence that structural genome variation plays a major role in determining traits important for breeding and agriculture. Identifying the extent and impact of structural variants in crop genomes is becoming increasingly feasible with ongoing advances in the sophistication of genome sequencing technologies, particularly as it becomes easier to generate accurate long sequence reads on a genomewide scale. In this article, we discuss the origins of structural genome variation in crops from ancient and recent genome duplication and polyploidization events and review high-throughput methods to assay such variants in crop populations in order to find associations with phenotypic traits. There is increasing evidence from such studies that gene presence–absence and copy number variation resulting from segmental chromosome exchanges may be at the heart of adaptive variation of crops to counter abiotic and biotic stress factors. We present examples from major crops that demonstrate the potential of pangenomic diversity as a key resource for future plant breeding for resilience and sustainability.},
